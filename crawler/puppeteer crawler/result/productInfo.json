          "review": "The LG C3 OLED is the latest model in LG’s popular C series of OLED TVs, which have consistently delivered excellent picture quality and features for high-end shoppers or for shoppers looking for something closer in price to mid-range TVs while delivering S-tier performance. The C3 OLED boasts a sleek and minimalist design with an ultra-thin panel. The C3 OLED also supports four HDMI 2.1 inputs with various gaming features, such as 4K 120Hz, VRR, ALLM, FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync12. For the purposes of my review, we're going to focus on gaming, as that's been my overwhelming, primary use for this TV since it arrived and I got it all setup a little over a month ago. Here are my thoughts for the gamers reading this, and I hope it helps you make a decision -- this is for the 65\" model:\n\nThe LG C3 OLED is a great TV for gaming on various platforms, and I have connected and used virtually every type of gaming experience, such as PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X, and even my ROG Ally. Here are some details about its gaming performance:\n\n- The LG C3 OLED supports 4K 120Hz gaming on all four HDMI 2.1 ports, which means you can enjoy smooth and detailed gameplay on the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The TV also supports VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync, which can reduce screen tearing and stuttering and optimize the input lag.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a very low input lag of around 10ms, which is ideal for fast-paced games that require quick reactions. The TV also has a near-instant response time of less than 1ms, which means motion blur is minimal and action scenes are clear and crisp.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a wide color gamut and a high contrast ratio, which can deliver stunning HDR gaming with vivid colors and deep blacks. The TV supports Dolby Vision IQ, which can adjust the HDR picture based on the ambient light in the room, and HGiG, which can optimize the HDR gaming experience according to the TV's capabilities.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED can also handle lower-resolution gaming well, thanks to its upscaling technology that can enhance the image quality of 1080p or 1440p content. The TV can also play 8- and 16-bit games from the Nintendo Switch without any noticeable banding or artifacts.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a new feature called Game Optimizer, which is a dedicated menu that allows you to adjust various gaming settings, such as black stabilizer, white stabilizer, low latency mode, and sound mode. You can also access the Game Optimizer from the Magic Remote by pressing the Game Optimizer button.\n\nOverall, the LG C3 OLED is a versatile and impressive TV for gaming on different platforms, and it can provide a smooth, immersive, and enjoyable gaming experience that won't break the bank."

          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "This is my first OLED TV and all I can say is WOW! If you’ve only had LCD TVs in the past, the OLED difference is very noticeable with the infinite contrast and 3D look that it gives to the image. My biggest concern with this TV was that it wouldn’t be bright enough but even during the day with 3 windows shining light into the room I’ve found it’s plenty bright enough, and a lot brighter than the budget LCD TV I had before (Vizio M658-G1). LG supports everything you could want in terms of gaming with 4 HDMI 2.1 ports for 4k/120Hz Dolby Vision gaming, VRR, ALLM, etc. I play Xbox Series X on it and it looks amazing! I also play Nintendo Switch and with a few tweaks like upping sharpness to 15 and turning Super Resolution to high it looks almost 4k! Everything I’ve watched on it looks better than ever before and I can’t say enough good things about it. After considering all my options I decided on this TV over the other options:\n- Compared to the LG G3: A lot cheaper but with the same processor for equal upscaling and clarity. The G3 is noticeably brighter but, like I said, I haven’t felt like the C3 wasn’t bright enough and it was brighter than I expected\n- Compared to the Samsung S95C: Again, much cheaper and the processor is better than that on the S95C so lower quality content will look cleaner, especially lower bitrate like YouTube TV. The S95C is much brighter and more colorful but Samsung has quality control issues, poor firmware updates, and no Dolby Vision HDR support\n- Compared to LG C2: The C3 is very similar to the C2 and it’s hard to justify the price increase of the C3. It was worth it to me since I got a good deal and only paid a few hundred dollars more. The C3 has an improved processor with improved dynamic tone mapping with 20,000 zones instead of 5,000 and is a little bit brighter. It also supports DTS passthrough and QMS unlike the C2. A common complaint about LG OLEDs is their aggressive dimming during prolonged high APL scenes. That issue was fixed on the 2023 models. Lastly, the C3 has a new customizable quick access menu that’s nice for changing settings in a snap\n- Compared to Samsung S90C: This is the C3’s biggest competition this year because they are close in price. The S90C has the better QD-OLED panel and is brighter and more colorful. I went with the C3 because of the Samsung issues I mentioned above with the S95C. I just trust LG more than Samsung as a company to support their products for years to come. Also, QD-OLED appears to have more risk of burn-in and I like to keep my TVs for a long time\n- Compared to Samsung S95B (2022 model): I wanted a 77” TV and the S95B only comes in 55” and 65”. Also, Samsung issues I mentioned before\n\nConclusion: The C3 is probably the best all around OLED TV for most people. Everything I’ve watched on this looks incredible and LG is a brand you can trust when it comes to OLED. They’ve been making them longer than anyone else and they’ve figured out how to prevent burn-in for the vast majority of users. If all you do is watch news or sports channels all day long then OLED probably isn’t for you but if you watch a variety of content from movies, TV shows, gaming, etc then I think this might be the best TV you can buy. Unless you can afford the LG G3, of course"

          "review": " I had an old Vizio 50” for many years, I’d guess about 8 years. While I had the money, I just never wanted to spend it since the TV was fine for me.\n\nWell, I got some Christmas gifts that were money, with the express idea of helping me buy a TV. I chose this 65” LG OLED. It’s enormous, possibly too big for a 1Br apartment tbh, lol. I had to move my couch back a little bit.\n\nThe blacks are jet black, and the whites (simultaneously) are bright enough that it looks like glare coming from them. It’s a vast difference from my old TV. The picture is amazing, and it’s 120 Hz. Coupled with a PS5 (or Xbox, or PC) it’s awesome, it even has a substantial amount of gaming settings and a little gaming dashboard. It’s like a whole different experience than my old TV. It also has all of the modern smart TV features, including of course streaming services (I used to have to use my PS5 for HBO Max, but no longer).\n\nI love it tbh. It’s a lot of money for something that honestly would be fine at a lower quality offering, but I’m happy with it.\n\nIt was delivered with “chose the room” type of service, which I picked because I live on the second floor, so they carried it up for me. I set it up myself and disposed of the box/garbage.\n\nMake sure if you lift the top of the box off to get to the TV that you pull out the foam insert in the top of it, that’s where the remote and stuff is. Lifting the top off is best in case you want to save the box intact, but the foam piece is basically pressed in there, so you’ll have to carefully pull it out from the very top of the box. At first i thought I was missing stuff because I’m not the brightest.\n\nThe sound is like having small PC speakers with a subwoofer, it’s far beyond my old TV. It has very loud bass, not like older TVs.\n\nIf you haven’t upgraded in a while, it’s a pretty cool experience. It has a ton of features and settings. I love it, no issues so far and set up was extremely fast (I don’t have cable, I only use streaming stuff, so maybe that’s why). Slowest thing was downloading the LG app and making a profile, then connecting. Otherwise? Very fast and easy."

The picture is amazing and the sound output is so-so (as expected). We are currently using the apps on the LG TV. So far the LG apps are not bad but we may switch back to ROKU. Again, no surprise there since most reviews slam all of the TV app systems. The remote is really something for those of us who have not had a TV upgrade in a long time. Point it at the TV and a cursor appears to speed up navigation. Also does voice commands. The OK button in the middle of the navigation buttons is a wheel that allows you to scroll. It probably does more stuff that I haven't discovered yet. Nice remote. Great TV."

Once you learn it, it is fine - or switch to voice control after setting up your favorites and leave the remote in a drawer."

However when I searched to install the app it was not available, when I called LG customer service they said I need to purchase a Firestick or Roku in order to get the app. LG apparently doesn’t have an agreement with Dish TV to allow the app to be installed. Frustrating since I paid $1,000 for a “smart tv” and it can’t deliver a basic app. Now I have to purchase a Firestick which seems redundant (and a waste) for a brand new smart TV."

          "review": "This is pure OLED. Nothing better. Every other TV tech over the last 20 years has been a workaround for NOT being OLED. Mini-LED is as close as it gets to OLED and it still pales in comparison to OLED.\n\nOLED is pure, unadulterated picture. Combined with modern processing, 120Hz, 4K+ and modern connectivity and smart features and you have a powerhouse, beastly TV.\n\nGorgeous frame. 1/4” thin screen is mind bending. Premium OLED branding on back of TV, Stand and more.\n\nThe picture is absolutely gorgeous. Infinite contrast down to the single pixel level. Expression enhancer and tone mapping make it look 3D jumping off the screen when viewing certain content. I’m upgrading from a 60” LG 4K LED HDR from 2016 that had some serious internal problems. It’s a world of difference now.\n\nI will say, LG’s picture presets take A LOT of manipulating and adjusting to get your perfect preferred settings for each one. ( it saves it and says “User settings” in parentheses after you adjust it. So you know you’ve changed it. ) If you don’t know what you are doing or what to look for in these settings you will be losing out on precious image quality. I’m not sure why they let these panels ship with such horribly calibrated settings when these are part of their premium OLED line. But it’s not a huge issue. Just takes some time and input. If you don’t have the knowledge do some quick research online and you’ll be good to go.\n\nIt’s worth the premium. Don’t go back to LCD tech. Backlights are terrible."

You can depend on this television to actually work as advertised, and save your valuable time buying the wrong products and returning them later. In the past, I'd be hesitant to connect other products online, but this one has functioned without interruption. So far, updates serve the system well! It adapts to the content being played. It has plenty of options to adapt settings yourself. It works perfectly with my surround sound system. It adapts well to the programmed content and maximizes broadcast offerings. I love how it can function as both a \"still\" and \"moving art frame\" as well, with content that is \"always on\" in low power and improves the look of your living space. Handles all incoming data from my console seamlessly. Handles all \"technological handshakes\" like a pro! Plenty of HDMI 2.1 connections! Very thin, sleek and sharp design! Light! Amazing product!"

You basically are signing your life & privacy away to use this TV. Sign up is convoluted & difficult, significantly hampered by the remote constantly switching modes between pointer & digital pad mode.\n\nOut of the box, once you get past all the activation menu's, default settings for filmmaker mode does not have those nice inky blacks, it is about equivolent to a high grade VA panel levels light bleed. Trying to find & use settings to correct this without affecting peak brightness was quite time consuming but I was able to finally accomplish that. Please note that part of my difficulty setting this up is due to my age related shakiness & having had a previous stroke which affected me physically but not intellectually.\n\nOnce I finally got this set up the picture was everything I was hoping it would be. Definately brighter than my LG 27\" OLED monitor in its most accurate settings.\n\nOnce properly set up the picture can at times take on a 3D like appearance without any grayish haze that you get with even they best LCD type TV's or monitors including those with the mini LED type backlights. Granted it is quite subtle but still there on the mini LED type TV's.\n\nOnce you get past set up issues this is quite possibly the best TV in it's size class.\n\nIf it was just based on picture alone it would get 5 stars but set up issues & remote functionality & ease of use down grade this to 4 stars.\n\nNote; that to experience the best viewing one should be in a darkened room as due to its inky blacks & amount of detail in the dark areas of the screen which is the way movies were meant to be watched anyway."

But it arrived and looks great not worth sending back to swap once I got it.\n\nAnti glare is pretty good. It’s a glossy tv not Matt finish which I like and the screen reduces glare quite a bit over my last tv. It has a pinkish violet color to the light reflection I think it cuts the white light reflected down by having it be a bit darker it still reflects some light but I can actually watch tv or movies with the lights on and not be annoyed. For serious watching like a movie I turn off the background lights in my room. But daytime viewing is excellent. oled is amazing I have top of the line Sony mini led and it is no competition. At the store I couldn’t tell the difference but at home where it’s not super bright lit room like a store I can see the difference\n\nAdd says they ship out in one day but it didn’t ship for 4-5 days but it did arrive on time the date it said it would. So i can’t fault them for that.\n\nSeller had lowest price anywhere. I think I got a special deal by luck but I do want to give them credit for great pricing.\n\nI would purchase from them again."

          "review": "This TV is absolutely stunning. When it comes to a home TV, OLED panels come out on top in every way and it's not even close. With this TV, LG checks all the boxes too in terms of desirable premium features. 4K, HDR, 120hz, Dolby Vision & Atmos, VRR, ALLM, Nvidia G-Sync AND AMD Freesync Premium. Then the game optimizer mode that brings it all conveniently together in one menu. In my opinion, this is the best TV around right now for gaming. Even aside from gaming, watching any kind of content is a great experience as well. My previous TV was a now 4 year old 50 inch TCL Roku TV, which doesn't even come close to comparing in any way. This is my first time going for a high end more expensive TV like this and I'm very happy with my choice for sure. If you're looking to get a more premium display and you're a gamer as well then this is the one for you!"

Yes, they brought the TV into my home, yes they unpacked and attached the stand to the TV, yes they set the TV in place, and yes they took away all the debris. But after they left, I found two screws and three plastic mystery parts on the counter. Since everything seemed to be working perfectly and since nothing was falling apart, I just tossed these \"extra\" parts (I'm trying to NOT continue to throw stuff in our \"junk drawer\".\n\nThen last week I decided to replace our other aging TV with a second one of these great LG TVs. Concierge delivery was no longer an option so I unboxed and set up the TV myself (Youtube has several wonderful videos on this). It was simple and I immediately saw where the two missing screws should have been inserted in the TV stand. Also saw where the three missing plastic mystery pieces should have been attached.\n\nI don't think that these unused screws and cord holder plastic (mystery) pieces are an issue but I am surprised that the delivery guys, who said they set up these TV all the time, would have failed to finish these set-up details."

At least there are some options to do this that are on by default. Also check after every update cause they like to sneak in and reset these options.\nOther than that my experience has been great. Considering all the major manufactures are building in these \"smart\" features, there's not much you can do about that part.\nI use external stream boxes mainly because of this.

My recommendation, if you're in the market for the best quality TV and can't quite justify spending $5000 on the M3 model, this C3 is 100% the way to go.

          "review": "The LG C3 OLED is the latest model in LG’s popular C series of OLED TVs, which have consistently delivered excellent picture quality and features for high-end shoppers or for shoppers looking for something closer in price to mid-range TVs while delivering S-tier performance. The C3 OLED boasts a sleek and minimalist design with an ultra-thin panel. The C3 OLED also supports four HDMI 2.1 inputs with various gaming features, such as 4K 120Hz, VRR, ALLM, FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync12. For the purposes of my review, we're going to focus on gaming, as that's been my overwhelming, primary use for this TV since it arrived and I got it all setup a little over a month ago. Here are my thoughts for the gamers reading this, and I hope it helps you make a decision -- this is for the 65\" model:\n\nThe LG C3 OLED is a great TV for gaming on various platforms, and I have connected and used virtually every type of gaming experience, such as PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X, and even my ROG Ally. Here are some details about its gaming performance:\n\n- The LG C3 OLED supports 4K 120Hz gaming on all four HDMI 2.1 ports, which means you can enjoy smooth and detailed gameplay on the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The TV also supports VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync, which can reduce screen tearing and stuttering and optimize the input lag.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a very low input lag of around 10ms, which is ideal for fast-paced games that require quick reactions. The TV also has a near-instant response time of less than 1ms, which means motion blur is minimal and action scenes are clear and crisp.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a wide color gamut and a high contrast ratio, which can deliver stunning HDR gaming with vivid colors and deep blacks. The TV supports Dolby Vision IQ, which can adjust the HDR picture based on the ambient light in the room, and HGiG, which can optimize the HDR gaming experience according to the TV's capabilities.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED can also handle lower-resolution gaming well, thanks to its upscaling technology that can enhance the image quality of 1080p or 1440p content. The TV can also play 8- and 16-bit games from the Nintendo Switch without any noticeable banding or artifacts.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a new feature called Game Optimizer, which is a dedicated menu that allows you to adjust various gaming settings, such as black stabilizer, white stabilizer, low latency mode, and sound mode. You can also access the Game Optimizer from the Magic Remote by pressing the Game Optimizer button.\n\nOverall, the LG C3 OLED is a versatile and impressive TV for gaming on different platforms, and it can provide a smooth, immersive, and enjoyable gaming experience that won't break the bank."

          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "This is my first OLED TV and all I can say is WOW! If you’ve only had LCD TVs in the past, the OLED difference is very noticeable with the infinite contrast and 3D look that it gives to the image. My biggest concern with this TV was that it wouldn’t be bright enough but even during the day with 3 windows shining light into the room I’ve found it’s plenty bright enough, and a lot brighter than the budget LCD TV I had before (Vizio M658-G1). LG supports everything you could want in terms of gaming with 4 HDMI 2.1 ports for 4k/120Hz Dolby Vision gaming, VRR, ALLM, etc. I play Xbox Series X on it and it looks amazing! I also play Nintendo Switch and with a few tweaks like upping sharpness to 15 and turning Super Resolution to high it looks almost 4k! Everything I’ve watched on it looks better than ever before and I can’t say enough good things about it. After considering all my options I decided on this TV over the other options:\n- Compared to the LG G3: A lot cheaper but with the same processor for equal upscaling and clarity. The G3 is noticeably brighter but, like I said, I haven’t felt like the C3 wasn’t bright enough and it was brighter than I expected\n- Compared to the Samsung S95C: Again, much cheaper and the processor is better than that on the S95C so lower quality content will look cleaner, especially lower bitrate like YouTube TV. The S95C is much brighter and more colorful but Samsung has quality control issues, poor firmware updates, and no Dolby Vision HDR support\n- Compared to LG C2: The C3 is very similar to the C2 and it’s hard to justify the price increase of the C3. It was worth it to me since I got a good deal and only paid a few hundred dollars more. The C3 has an improved processor with improved dynamic tone mapping with 20,000 zones instead of 5,000 and is a little bit brighter. It also supports DTS passthrough and QMS unlike the C2. A common complaint about LG OLEDs is their aggressive dimming during prolonged high APL scenes. That issue was fixed on the 2023 models. Lastly, the C3 has a new customizable quick access menu that’s nice for changing settings in a snap\n- Compared to Samsung S90C: This is the C3’s biggest competition this year because they are close in price. The S90C has the better QD-OLED panel and is brighter and more colorful. I went with the C3 because of the Samsung issues I mentioned above with the S95C. I just trust LG more than Samsung as a company to support their products for years to come. Also, QD-OLED appears to have more risk of burn-in and I like to keep my TVs for a long time\n- Compared to Samsung S95B (2022 model): I wanted a 77” TV and the S95B only comes in 55” and 65”. Also, Samsung issues I mentioned before\n\nConclusion: The C3 is probably the best all around OLED TV for most people. Everything I’ve watched on this looks incredible and LG is a brand you can trust when it comes to OLED. They’ve been making them longer than anyone else and they’ve figured out how to prevent burn-in for the vast majority of users. If all you do is watch news or sports channels all day long then OLED probably isn’t for you but if you watch a variety of content from movies, TV shows, gaming, etc then I think this might be the best TV you can buy. Unless you can afford the LG G3, of course"

While I had the money, I just never wanted to spend it since the TV was fine for me.\n\nWell, I got some Christmas gifts that were money, with the express idea of helping me buy a TV. I chose this 65” LG OLED. It’s enormous, possibly too big for a 1Br apartment tbh, lol. I had to move my couch back a little bit.\n\nThe blacks are jet black, and the whites (simultaneously) are bright enough that it looks like glare coming from them. It’s a vast difference from my old TV. The picture is amazing, and it’s 120 Hz. Coupled with a PS5 (or Xbox, or PC) it’s awesome, it even has a substantial amount of gaming settings and a little gaming dashboard. It’s like a whole different experience than my old TV. It also has all of the modern smart TV features, including of course streaming services (I used to have to use my PS5 for HBO Max, but no longer).\n\nI love it tbh. It’s a lot of money for something that honestly would be fine at a lower quality offering, but I’m happy with it.\n\nIt was delivered with “chose the room” type of service, which I picked because I live on the second floor, so they carried it up for me. I set it up myself and disposed of the box/garbage.\n\nMake sure if you lift the top of the box off to get to the TV that you pull out the foam insert in the top of it, that’s where the remote and stuff is. Lifting the top off is best in case you want to save the box intact, but the foam piece is basically pressed in there, so you’ll have to carefully pull it out from the very top of the box. At first i thought I was missing stuff because I’m not the brightest.\n\nThe sound is like having small PC speakers with a subwoofer, it’s far beyond my old TV. It has very loud bass, not like older TVs.\n\nIf you haven’t upgraded in a while, it’s a pretty cool experience. It has a ton of features and settings. I love it, no issues so far and set up was extremely fast (I don’t have cable, I only use streaming stuff, so maybe that’s why). Slowest thing was downloading the LG app and making a profile, then connecting. Otherwise? Very fast and easy."

The picture is amazing and the sound output is so-so (as expected). We are currently using the apps on the LG TV. So far the LG apps are not bad but we may switch back to ROKU. Again, no surprise there since most reviews slam all of the TV app systems. The remote is really something for those of us who have not had a TV upgrade in a long time. Point it at the TV and a cursor appears to speed up navigation. Also does voice commands. The OK button in the middle of the navigation buttons is a wheel that allows you to scroll. It probably does more stuff that I haven't discovered yet. Nice remote. Great TV."

However when I searched to install the app it was not available, when I called LG customer service they said I need to purchase a Firestick or Roku in order to get the app. LG apparently doesn’t have an agreement with Dish TV to allow the app to be installed. Frustrating since I paid $1,000 for a “smart tv” and it can’t deliver a basic app. Now I have to purchase a Firestick which seems redundant (and a waste) for a brand new smart TV."

          "review": "This is pure OLED. Nothing better. Every other TV tech over the last 20 years has been a workaround for NOT being OLED. Mini-LED is as close as it gets to OLED and it still pales in comparison to OLED.\n\nOLED is pure, unadulterated picture. Combined with modern processing, 120Hz, 4K+ and modern connectivity and smart features and you have a powerhouse, beastly TV.\n\nGorgeous frame. 1/4” thin screen is mind bending. Premium OLED branding on back of TV, Stand and more.\n\nThe picture is absolutely gorgeous. Infinite contrast down to the single pixel level. Expression enhancer and tone mapping make it look 3D jumping off the screen when viewing certain content. I’m upgrading from a 60” LG 4K LED HDR from 2016 that had some serious internal problems. It’s a world of difference now.\n\nI will say, LG’s picture presets take A LOT of manipulating and adjusting to get your perfect preferred settings for each one. ( it saves it and says “User settings” in parentheses after you adjust it. So you know you’ve changed it. ) If you don’t know what you are doing or what to look for in these settings you will be losing out on precious image quality. I’m not sure why they let these panels ship with such horribly calibrated settings when these are part of their premium OLED line. But it’s not a huge issue. Just takes some time and input. If you don’t have the knowledge do some quick research online and you’ll be good to go.\n\nIt’s worth the premium. Don’t go back to LCD tech. Backlights are terrible."

You can depend on this television to actually work as advertised, and save your valuable time buying the wrong products and returning them later. In the past, I'd be hesitant to connect other products online, but this one has functioned without interruption. So far, updates serve the system well! It adapts to the content being played. It has plenty of options to adapt settings yourself. It works perfectly with my surround sound system. It adapts well to the programmed content and maximizes broadcast offerings. I love how it can function as both a \"still\" and \"moving art frame\" as well, with content that is \"always on\" in low power and improves the look of your living space. Handles all incoming data from my console seamlessly. Handles all \"technological handshakes\" like a pro! Plenty of HDMI 2.1 connections! Very thin, sleek and sharp design! Light! Amazing product!"

You basically are signing your life & privacy away to use this TV. Sign up is convoluted & difficult, significantly hampered by the remote constantly switching modes between pointer & digital pad mode.\n\nOut of the box, once you get past all the activation menu's, default settings for filmmaker mode does not have those nice inky blacks, it is about equivolent to a high grade VA panel levels light bleed. Trying to find & use settings to correct this without affecting peak brightness was quite time consuming but I was able to finally accomplish that. Please note that part of my difficulty setting this up is due to my age related shakiness & having had a previous stroke which affected me physically but not intellectually.\n\nOnce I finally got this set up the picture was everything I was hoping it would be. Definately brighter than my LG 27\" OLED monitor in its most accurate settings.\n\nOnce properly set up the picture can at times take on a 3D like appearance without any grayish haze that you get with even they best LCD type TV's or monitors including those with the mini LED type backlights. Granted it is quite subtle but still there on the mini LED type TV's.\n\nOnce you get past set up issues this is quite possibly the best TV in it's size class.\n\nIf it was just based on picture alone it would get 5 stars but set up issues & remote functionality & ease of use down grade this to 4 stars.\n\nNote; that to experience the best viewing one should be in a darkened room as due to its inky blacks & amount of detail in the dark areas of the screen which is the way movies were meant to be watched anyway."

But it arrived and looks great not worth sending back to swap once I got it.\n\nAnti glare is pretty good. It’s a glossy tv not Matt finish which I like and the screen reduces glare quite a bit over my last tv. It has a pinkish violet color to the light reflection I think it cuts the white light reflected down by having it be a bit darker it still reflects some light but I can actually watch tv or movies with the lights on and not be annoyed. For serious watching like a movie I turn off the background lights in my room. But daytime viewing is excellent. oled is amazing I have top of the line Sony mini led and it is no competition. At the store I couldn’t tell the difference but at home where it’s not super bright lit room like a store I can see the difference\n\nAdd says they ship out in one day but it didn’t ship for 4-5 days but it did arrive on time the date it said it would. So i can’t fault them for that.\n\nSeller had lowest price anywhere. I think I got a special deal by luck but I do want to give them credit for great pricing.\n\nI would purchase from them again."

Then the game optimizer mode that brings it all conveniently together in one menu. In my opinion, this is the best TV around right now for gaming. Even aside from gaming, watching any kind of content is a great experience as well. My previous TV was a now 4 year old 50 inch TCL Roku TV, which doesn't even come close to comparing in any way. This is my first time going for a high end more expensive TV like this and I'm very happy with my choice for sure.

Concierge delivery was no longer an option so I unboxed and set up the TV myself (Youtube has several wonderful videos on this). It was simple and I immediately saw where the two missing screws should have been inserted in the TV stand. Also saw where the three missing plastic mystery pieces should have been attached.\n\nI don't think that these unused screws and cord holder plastic (mystery) pieces are an issue but I am surprised that the delivery guys, who said they set up these TV all the time, would have failed to finish these set-up details."

          "review": "The LG C3 OLED is the latest model in LG’s popular C series of OLED TVs, which have consistently delivered excellent picture quality and features for high-end shoppers or for shoppers looking for something closer in price to mid-range TVs while delivering S-tier performance. The C3 OLED boasts a sleek and minimalist design with an ultra-thin panel. The C3 OLED also supports four HDMI 2.1 inputs with various gaming features, such as 4K 120Hz, VRR, ALLM, FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync12. For the purposes of my review, we're going to focus on gaming, as that's been my overwhelming, primary use for this TV since it arrived and I got it all setup a little over a month ago. Here are my thoughts for the gamers reading this, and I hope it helps you make a decision -- this is for the 65\" model:\n\nThe LG C3 OLED is a great TV for gaming on various platforms, and I have connected and used virtually every type of gaming experience, such as PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X, and even my ROG Ally. Here are some details about its gaming performance:\n\n- The LG C3 OLED supports 4K 120Hz gaming on all four HDMI 2.1 ports, which means you can enjoy smooth and detailed gameplay on the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The TV also supports VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync, which can reduce screen tearing and stuttering and optimize the input lag.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a very low input lag of around 10ms, which is ideal for fast-paced games that require quick reactions. The TV also has a near-instant response time of less than 1ms, which means motion blur is minimal and action scenes are clear and crisp.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a wide color gamut and a high contrast ratio, which can deliver stunning HDR gaming with vivid colors and deep blacks. The TV supports Dolby Vision IQ, which can adjust the HDR picture based on the ambient light in the room, and HGiG, which can optimize the HDR gaming experience according to the TV's capabilities.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED can also handle lower-resolution gaming well, thanks to its upscaling technology that can enhance the image quality of 1080p or 1440p content. The TV can also play 8- and 16-bit games from the Nintendo Switch without any noticeable banding or artifacts.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a new feature called Game Optimizer, which is a dedicated menu that allows you to adjust various gaming settings, such as black stabilizer, white stabilizer, low latency mode, and sound mode. You can also access the Game Optimizer from the Magic Remote by pressing the Game Optimizer button.\n\nOverall, the LG C3 OLED is a versatile and impressive TV for gaming on different platforms, and it can provide a smooth, immersive, and enjoyable gaming experience that won't break the bank."

          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "This is my first OLED TV and all I can say is WOW! If you’ve only had LCD TVs in the past, the OLED difference is very noticeable with the infinite contrast and 3D look that it gives to the image. My biggest concern with this TV was that it wouldn’t be bright enough but even during the day with 3 windows shining light into the room I’ve found it’s plenty bright enough, and a lot brighter than the budget LCD TV I had before (Vizio M658-G1). LG supports everything you could want in terms of gaming with 4 HDMI 2.1 ports for 4k/120Hz Dolby Vision gaming, VRR, ALLM, etc. I play Xbox Series X on it and it looks amazing! I also play Nintendo Switch and with a few tweaks like upping sharpness to 15 and turning Super Resolution to high it looks almost 4k! Everything I’ve watched on it looks better than ever before and I can’t say enough good things about it. After considering all my options I decided on this TV over the other options:\n- Compared to the LG G3: A lot cheaper but with the same processor for equal upscaling and clarity. The G3 is noticeably brighter but, like I said, I haven’t felt like the C3 wasn’t bright enough and it was brighter than I expected\n- Compared to the Samsung S95C: Again, much cheaper and the processor is better than that on the S95C so lower quality content will look cleaner, especially lower bitrate like YouTube TV. The S95C is much brighter and more colorful but Samsung has quality control issues, poor firmware updates, and no Dolby Vision HDR support\n- Compared to LG C2: The C3 is very similar to the C2 and it’s hard to justify the price increase of the C3. It was worth it to me since I got a good deal and only paid a few hundred dollars more. The C3 has an improved processor with improved dynamic tone mapping with 20,000 zones instead of 5,000 and is a little bit brighter. It also supports DTS passthrough and QMS unlike the C2. A common complaint about LG OLEDs is their aggressive dimming during prolonged high APL scenes. That issue was fixed on the 2023 models. Lastly, the C3 has a new customizable quick access menu that’s nice for changing settings in a snap\n- Compared to Samsung S90C: This is the C3’s biggest competition this year because they are close in price. The S90C has the better QD-OLED panel and is brighter and more colorful. I went with the C3 because of the Samsung issues I mentioned above with the S95C. I just trust LG more than Samsung as a company to support their products for years to come. Also, QD-OLED appears to have more risk of burn-in and I like to keep my TVs for a long time\n- Compared to Samsung S95B (2022 model): I wanted a 77” TV and the S95B only comes in 55” and 65”. Also, Samsung issues I mentioned before\n\nConclusion: The C3 is probably the best all around OLED TV for most people. Everything I’ve watched on this looks incredible and LG is a brand you can trust when it comes to OLED. They’ve been making them longer than anyone else and they’ve figured out how to prevent burn-in for the vast majority of users. If all you do is watch news or sports channels all day long then OLED probably isn’t for you but if you watch a variety of content from movies, TV shows, gaming, etc then I think this might be the best TV you can buy. Unless you can afford the LG G3, of course"

          "review": " I had an old Vizio 50” for many years, I’d guess about 8 years. While I had the money, I just never wanted to spend it since the TV was fine for me.\n\nWell, I got some Christmas gifts that were money, with the express idea of helping me buy a TV. I chose this 65” LG OLED. It’s enormous, possibly too big for a 1Br apartment tbh, lol. I had to move my couch back a little bit.\n\nThe blacks are jet black, and the whites (simultaneously) are bright enough that it looks like glare coming from them. It’s a vast difference from my old TV. The picture is amazing, and it’s 120 Hz. Coupled with a PS5 (or Xbox, or PC) it’s awesome, it even has a substantial amount of gaming settings and a little gaming dashboard. It’s like a whole different experience than my old TV. It also has all of the modern smart TV features, including of course streaming services (I used to have to use my PS5 for HBO Max, but no longer).\n\nI love it tbh. It’s a lot of money for something that honestly would be fine at a lower quality offering, but I’m happy with it.\n\nIt was delivered with “chose the room” type of service, which I picked because I live on the second floor, so they carried it up for me. I set it up myself and disposed of the box/garbage.\n\nMake sure if you lift the top of the box off to get to the TV that you pull out the foam insert in the top of it, that’s where the remote and stuff is. Lifting the top off is best in case you want to save the box intact, but the foam piece is basically pressed in there, so you’ll have to carefully pull it out from the very top of the box. At first i thought I was missing stuff because I’m not the brightest.\n\nThe sound is like having small PC speakers with a subwoofer, it’s far beyond my old TV. It has very loud bass, not like older TVs.\n\nIf you haven’t upgraded in a while, it’s a pretty cool experience. It has a ton of features and settings. I love it, no issues so far and set up was extremely fast (I don’t have cable, I only use streaming stuff, so maybe that’s why). Slowest thing was downloading the LG app and making a profile, then connecting. Otherwise? Very fast and easy."

The picture is amazing and the sound output is so-so (as expected). We are currently using the apps on the LG TV. So far the LG apps are not bad but we may switch back to ROKU. Again, no surprise there since most reviews slam all of the TV app systems. The remote is really something for those of us who have not had a TV upgrade in a long time. Point it at the TV and a cursor appears to speed up navigation. Also does voice commands. The OK button in the middle of the navigation buttons is a wheel that allows you to scroll. It probably does more stuff that I haven't discovered yet. Nice remote. Great TV."

Once you learn it, it is fine - or switch to voice control after setting up your favorites and leave the remote in a drawer."

However when I searched to install the app it was not available, when I called LG customer service they said I need to purchase a Firestick or Roku in order to get the app. LG apparently doesn’t have an agreement with Dish TV to allow the app to be installed. Frustrating since I paid $1,000 for a “smart tv” and it can’t deliver a basic app. Now I have to purchase a Firestick which seems redundant (and a waste) for a brand new smart TV."

          "review": "This is pure OLED. Nothing better. Every other TV tech over the last 20 years has been a workaround for NOT being OLED. Mini-LED is as close as it gets to OLED and it still pales in comparison to OLED.\n\nOLED is pure, unadulterated picture. Combined with modern processing, 120Hz, 4K+ and modern connectivity and smart features and you have a powerhouse, beastly TV.\n\nGorgeous frame. 1/4” thin screen is mind bending. Premium OLED branding on back of TV, Stand and more.\n\nThe picture is absolutely gorgeous. Infinite contrast down to the single pixel level. Expression enhancer and tone mapping make it look 3D jumping off the screen when viewing certain content. I’m upgrading from a 60” LG 4K LED HDR from 2016 that had some serious internal problems. It’s a world of difference now.\n\nI will say, LG’s picture presets take A LOT of manipulating and adjusting to get your perfect preferred settings for each one. ( it saves it and says “User settings” in parentheses after you adjust it. So you know you’ve changed it. ) If you don’t know what you are doing or what to look for in these settings you will be losing out on precious image quality. I’m not sure why they let these panels ship with such horribly calibrated settings when these are part of their premium OLED line. But it’s not a huge issue. Just takes some time and input. If you don’t have the knowledge do some quick research online and you’ll be good to go.\n\nIt’s worth the premium. Don’t go back to LCD tech. Backlights are terrible."

You can depend on this television to actually work as advertised, and save your valuable time buying the wrong products and returning them later. In the past, I'd be hesitant to connect other products online, but this one has functioned without interruption. So far, updates serve the system well! It adapts to the content being played. It has plenty of options to adapt settings yourself. It works perfectly with my surround sound system. It adapts well to the programmed content and maximizes broadcast offerings. I love how it can function as both a \"still\" and \"moving art frame\" as well, with content that is \"always on\" in low power and improves the look of your living space. Handles all incoming data from my console seamlessly. Handles all \"technological handshakes\" like a pro! Plenty of HDMI 2.1 connections! Very thin, sleek and sharp design! Light! Amazing product!"

You basically are signing your life & privacy away to use this TV. Sign up is convoluted & difficult, significantly hampered by the remote constantly switching modes between pointer & digital pad mode.\n\nOut of the box, once you get past all the activation menu's, default settings for filmmaker mode does not have those nice inky blacks, it is about equivolent to a high grade VA panel levels light bleed. Trying to find & use settings to correct this without affecting peak brightness was quite time consuming but I was able to finally accomplish that. Please note that part of my difficulty setting this up is due to my age related shakiness & having had a previous stroke which affected me physically but not intellectually.\n\nOnce I finally got this set up the picture was everything I was hoping it would be. Definately brighter than my LG 27\" OLED monitor in its most accurate settings.\n\nOnce properly set up the picture can at times take on a 3D like appearance without any grayish haze that you get with even they best LCD type TV's or monitors including those with the mini LED type backlights. Granted it is quite subtle but still there on the mini LED type TV's.\n\nOnce you get past set up issues this is quite possibly the best TV in it's size class.\n\nIf it was just based on picture alone it would get 5 stars but set up issues & remote functionality & ease of use down grade this to 4 stars.\n\nNote; that to experience the best viewing one should be in a darkened room as due to its inky blacks & amount of detail in the dark areas of the screen which is the way movies were meant to be watched anyway."

But it arrived and looks great not worth sending back to swap once I got it.\n\nAnti glare is pretty good. It’s a glossy tv not Matt finish which I like and the screen reduces glare quite a bit over my last tv. It has a pinkish violet color to the light reflection I think it cuts the white light reflected down by having it be a bit darker it still reflects some light but I can actually watch tv or movies with the lights on and not be annoyed. For serious watching like a movie I turn off the background lights in my room. But daytime viewing is excellent. oled is amazing I have top of the line Sony mini led and it is no competition. At the store I couldn’t tell the difference but at home where it’s not super bright lit room like a store I can see the difference\n\nAdd says they ship out in one day but it didn’t ship for 4-5 days but it did arrive on time the date it said it would. So i can’t fault them for that.\n\nSeller had lowest price anywhere. I think I got a special deal by luck but I do want to give them credit for great pricing.\n\nI would purchase from them again."

Then the game optimizer mode that brings it all conveniently together in one menu. In my opinion, this is the best TV around right now for gaming. Even aside from gaming, watching any kind of content is a great experience as well. My previous TV was a now 4 year old 50 inch TCL Roku TV, which doesn't even come close to comparing in any way. This is my first time going for a high end more expensive TV like this and I'm very happy with my choice for sure.

          "review": "While this TV is spectacular, I had a small issue with the full-service concierge delivery. Yes, they brought the TV into my home, yes they unpacked and attached the stand to the TV, yes they set the TV in place, and yes they took away all the debris. But after they left, I found two screws and three plastic mystery parts on the counter. Since everything seemed to be working perfectly and since nothing was falling apart, I just tossed these \"extra\" parts (I'm trying to NOT continue to throw stuff in our \"junk drawer\".\n\nThen last week I decided to replace our other aging TV with a second one of these great LG TVs. Concierge delivery was no longer an option so I unboxed and set up the TV myself (Youtube has several wonderful videos on this). It was simple and I immediately saw where the two missing screws should have been inserted in the TV stand. Also saw where the three missing plastic mystery pieces should have been attached.\n\nI don't think that these unused screws and cord holder plastic (mystery) pieces are an issue but I am surprised that the delivery guys, who said they set up these TV all the time, would have failed to finish these set-up details."

There is a higher level LG G-3 supposed to be brighter, if that is your main concern, but no reason to spend 1k more....and G3 tech is new. I have enjoyed this tv like no other I have experienced before. My advice: do some research on Sony and Samsung but keep these important aspects in mind. This TV has better protection against burn in and is brighter."

I dont like the trend of spyware built into these TVs so they can keep making money off of us even after we spent an arm and a leg on the hardware its self.\nDO yourself a favor and disable these to the best you can. At least there are some options to do this that are on by default. Also check after every update cause they like to sneak in and reset these options.\nOther than that my experience has been great. Considering all the major manufactures are building in these \"smart\" features, there's not much you can do about that part.\nI use external stream boxes mainly because of this. They aren't really any better though."

Going from a 120\" screen projected by an Optoma HD28HDR to this is a night and day difference. The vibrancy this tv offers is truly wonderful! Who knew downsizing could be this exciting!! My recommendation, if you're in the market for the best quality TV and can't quite justify spending $5000 on the M3 model, this C3 is 100% the way to go. Best price to quality on the market as of 01/2024"

          "review": "The LG C3 OLED is the latest model in LG’s popular C series of OLED TVs, which have consistently delivered excellent picture quality and features for high-end shoppers or for shoppers looking for something closer in price to mid-range TVs while delivering S-tier performance. The C3 OLED boasts a sleek and minimalist design with an ultra-thin panel. The C3 OLED also supports four HDMI 2.1 inputs with various gaming features, such as 4K 120Hz, VRR, ALLM, FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync12. For the purposes of my review, we're going to focus on gaming, as that's been my overwhelming, primary use for this TV since it arrived and I got it all setup a little over a month ago. Here are my thoughts for the gamers reading this, and I hope it helps you make a decision -- this is for the 65\" model:\n\nThe LG C3 OLED is a great TV for gaming on various platforms, and I have connected and used virtually every type of gaming experience, such as PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X, and even my ROG Ally. Here are some details about its gaming performance:\n\n- The LG C3 OLED supports 4K 120Hz gaming on all four HDMI 2.1 ports, which means you can enjoy smooth and detailed gameplay on the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The TV also supports VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync, which can reduce screen tearing and stuttering and optimize the input lag.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a very low input lag of around 10ms, which is ideal for fast-paced games that require quick reactions. The TV also has a near-instant response time of less than 1ms, which means motion blur is minimal and action scenes are clear and crisp.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a wide color gamut and a high contrast ratio, which can deliver stunning HDR gaming with vivid colors and deep blacks. The TV supports Dolby Vision IQ, which can adjust the HDR picture based on the ambient light in the room, and HGiG, which can optimize the HDR gaming experience according to the TV's capabilities.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED can also handle lower-resolution gaming well, thanks to its upscaling technology that can enhance the image quality of 1080p or 1440p content. The TV can also play 8- and 16-bit games from the Nintendo Switch without any noticeable banding or artifacts.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a new feature called Game Optimizer, which is a dedicated menu that allows you to adjust various gaming settings, such as black stabilizer, white stabilizer, low latency mode, and sound mode. You can also access the Game Optimizer from the Magic Remote by pressing the Game Optimizer button.\n\nOverall, the LG C3 OLED is a versatile and impressive TV for gaming on different platforms, and it can provide a smooth, immersive, and enjoyable gaming experience that won't break the bank."

          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "This is my first OLED TV and all I can say is WOW! If you’ve only had LCD TVs in the past, the OLED difference is very noticeable with the infinite contrast and 3D look that it gives to the image. My biggest concern with this TV was that it wouldn’t be bright enough but even during the day with 3 windows shining light into the room I’ve found it’s plenty bright enough, and a lot brighter than the budget LCD TV I had before (Vizio M658-G1). LG supports everything you could want in terms of gaming with 4 HDMI 2.1 ports for 4k/120Hz Dolby Vision gaming, VRR, ALLM, etc. I play Xbox Series X on it and it looks amazing! I also play Nintendo Switch and with a few tweaks like upping sharpness to 15 and turning Super Resolution to high it looks almost 4k! Everything I’ve watched on it looks better than ever before and I can’t say enough good things about it. After considering all my options I decided on this TV over the other options:\n- Compared to the LG G3: A lot cheaper but with the same processor for equal upscaling and clarity. The G3 is noticeably brighter but, like I said, I haven’t felt like the C3 wasn’t bright enough and it was brighter than I expected\n- Compared to the Samsung S95C: Again, much cheaper and the processor is better than that on the S95C so lower quality content will look cleaner, especially lower bitrate like YouTube TV. The S95C is much brighter and more colorful but Samsung has quality control issues, poor firmware updates, and no Dolby Vision HDR support\n- Compared to LG C2: The C3 is very similar to the C2 and it’s hard to justify the price increase of the C3. It was worth it to me since I got a good deal and only paid a few hundred dollars more. The C3 has an improved processor with improved dynamic tone mapping with 20,000 zones instead of 5,000 and is a little bit brighter. It also supports DTS passthrough and QMS unlike the C2. A common complaint about LG OLEDs is their aggressive dimming during prolonged high APL scenes. That issue was fixed on the 2023 models. Lastly, the C3 has a new customizable quick access menu that’s nice for changing settings in a snap\n- Compared to Samsung S90C: This is the C3’s biggest competition this year because they are close in price. The S90C has the better QD-OLED panel and is brighter and more colorful. I went with the C3 because of the Samsung issues I mentioned above with the S95C. I just trust LG more than Samsung as a company to support their products for years to come. Also, QD-OLED appears to have more risk of burn-in and I like to keep my TVs for a long time\n- Compared to Samsung S95B (2022 model): I wanted a 77” TV and the S95B only comes in 55” and 65”. Also, Samsung issues I mentioned before\n\nConclusion: The C3 is probably the best all around OLED TV for most people. Everything I’ve watched on this looks incredible and LG is a brand you can trust when it comes to OLED. They’ve been making them longer than anyone else and they’ve figured out how to prevent burn-in for the vast majority of users. If all you do is watch news or sports channels all day long then OLED probably isn’t for you but if you watch a variety of content from movies, TV shows, gaming, etc then I think this might be the best TV you can buy. Unless you can afford the LG G3, of course"

          "review": " I had an old Vizio 50” for many years, I’d guess about 8 years. While I had the money, I just never wanted to spend it since the TV was fine for me.\n\nWell, I got some Christmas gifts that were money, with the express idea of helping me buy a TV. I chose this 65” LG OLED. It’s enormous, possibly too big for a 1Br apartment tbh, lol. I had to move my couch back a little bit.\n\nThe blacks are jet black, and the whites (simultaneously) are bright enough that it looks like glare coming from them. It’s a vast difference from my old TV. The picture is amazing, and it’s 120 Hz. Coupled with a PS5 (or Xbox, or PC) it’s awesome, it even has a substantial amount of gaming settings and a little gaming dashboard. It’s like a whole different experience than my old TV. It also has all of the modern smart TV features, including of course streaming services (I used to have to use my PS5 for HBO Max, but no longer).\n\nI love it tbh. It’s a lot of money for something that honestly would be fine at a lower quality offering, but I’m happy with it.\n\nIt was delivered with “chose the room” type of service, which I picked because I live on the second floor, so they carried it up for me. I set it up myself and disposed of the box/garbage.\n\nMake sure if you lift the top of the box off to get to the TV that you pull out the foam insert in the top of it, that’s where the remote and stuff is. Lifting the top off is best in case you want to save the box intact, but the foam piece is basically pressed in there, so you’ll have to carefully pull it out from the very top of the box. At first i thought I was missing stuff because I’m not the brightest.\n\nThe sound is like having small PC speakers with a subwoofer, it’s far beyond my old TV. It has very loud bass, not like older TVs.\n\nIf you haven’t upgraded in a while, it’s a pretty cool experience. It has a ton of features and settings. I love it, no issues so far and set up was extremely fast (I don’t have cable, I only use streaming stuff, so maybe that’s why). Slowest thing was downloading the LG app and making a profile, then connecting. Otherwise? Very fast and easy."

The picture is amazing and the sound output is so-so (as expected). We are currently using the apps on the LG TV. So far the LG apps are not bad but we may switch back to ROKU. Again, no surprise there since most reviews slam all of the TV app systems. The remote is really something for those of us who have not had a TV upgrade in a long time. Point it at the TV and a cursor appears to speed up navigation. Also does voice commands. The OK button in the middle of the navigation buttons is a wheel that allows you to scroll. It probably does more stuff that I haven't discovered yet. Nice remote. Great TV."

However when I searched to install the app it was not available, when I called LG customer service they said I need to purchase a Firestick or Roku in order to get the app. LG apparently doesn’t have an agreement with Dish TV to allow the app to be installed. Frustrating since I paid $1,000 for a “smart tv” and it can’t deliver a basic app. Now I have to purchase a Firestick which seems redundant (and a waste) for a brand new smart TV."

          "review": "This is pure OLED. Nothing better. Every other TV tech over the last 20 years has been a workaround for NOT being OLED. Mini-LED is as close as it gets to OLED and it still pales in comparison to OLED.\n\nOLED is pure, unadulterated picture. Combined with modern processing, 120Hz, 4K+ and modern connectivity and smart features and you have a powerhouse, beastly TV.\n\nGorgeous frame. 1/4” thin screen is mind bending. Premium OLED branding on back of TV, Stand and more.\n\nThe picture is absolutely gorgeous. Infinite contrast down to the single pixel level. Expression enhancer and tone mapping make it look 3D jumping off the screen when viewing certain content. I’m upgrading from a 60” LG 4K LED HDR from 2016 that had some serious internal problems. It’s a world of difference now.\n\nI will say, LG’s picture presets take A LOT of manipulating and adjusting to get your perfect preferred settings for each one. ( it saves it and says “User settings” in parentheses after you adjust it. So you know you’ve changed it. ) If you don’t know what you are doing or what to look for in these settings you will be losing out on precious image quality. I’m not sure why they let these panels ship with such horribly calibrated settings when these are part of their premium OLED line. But it’s not a huge issue. Just takes some time and input. If you don’t have the knowledge do some quick research online and you’ll be good to go.\n\nIt’s worth the premium. Don’t go back to LCD tech. Backlights are terrible."

You can depend on this television to actually work as advertised, and save your valuable time buying the wrong products and returning them later. In the past, I'd be hesitant to connect other products online, but this one has functioned without interruption. So far, updates serve the system well! It adapts to the content being played. It has plenty of options to adapt settings yourself. It works perfectly with my surround sound system. It adapts well to the programmed content and maximizes broadcast offerings. I love how it can function as both a \"still\" and \"moving art frame\" as well, with content that is \"always on\" in low power and improves the look of your living space. Handles all incoming data from my console seamlessly. Handles all \"technological handshakes\" like a pro! Plenty of HDMI 2.1 connections! Very thin, sleek and sharp design! Light! Amazing product!"

You basically are signing your life & privacy away to use this TV. Sign up is convoluted & difficult, significantly hampered by the remote constantly switching modes between pointer & digital pad mode.\n\nOut of the box, once you get past all the activation menu's, default settings for filmmaker mode does not have those nice inky blacks, it is about equivolent to a high grade VA panel levels light bleed. Trying to find & use settings to correct this without affecting peak brightness was quite time consuming but I was able to finally accomplish that. Please note that part of my difficulty setting this up is due to my age related shakiness & having had a previous stroke which affected me physically but not intellectually.\n\nOnce I finally got this set up the picture was everything I was hoping it would be. Definately brighter than my LG 27\" OLED monitor in its most accurate settings.\n\nOnce properly set up the picture can at times take on a 3D like appearance without any grayish haze that you get with even they best LCD type TV's or monitors including those with the mini LED type backlights. Granted it is quite subtle but still there on the mini LED type TV's.\n\nOnce you get past set up issues this is quite possibly the best TV in it's size class.\n\nIf it was just based on picture alone it would get 5 stars but set up issues & remote functionality & ease of use down grade this to 4 stars.\n\nNote; that to experience the best viewing one should be in a darkened room as due to its inky blacks & amount of detail in the dark areas of the screen which is the way movies were meant to be watched anyway."

But it arrived and looks great not worth sending back to swap once I got it.\n\nAnti glare is pretty good. It’s a glossy tv not Matt finish which I like and the screen reduces glare quite a bit over my last tv. It has a pinkish violet color to the light reflection I think it cuts the white light reflected down by having it be a bit darker it still reflects some light but I can actually watch tv or movies with the lights on and not be annoyed. For serious watching like a movie I turn off the background lights in my room. But daytime viewing is excellent. oled is amazing I have top of the line Sony mini led and it is no competition. At the store I couldn’t tell the difference but at home where it’s not super bright lit room like a store I can see the difference\n\nAdd says they ship out in one day but it didn’t ship for 4-5 days but it did arrive on time the date it said it would. So i can’t fault them for that.\n\nSeller had lowest price anywhere. I think I got a special deal by luck but I do want to give them credit for great pricing.\n\nI would purchase from them again."

With this TV, LG checks all the boxes too in terms of desirable premium features. 4K, HDR, 120hz, Dolby Vision & Atmos, VRR, ALLM, Nvidia G-Sync AND AMD Freesync Premium. Then the game optimizer mode that brings it all conveniently together in one menu. In my opinion, this is the best TV around right now for gaming. Even aside from gaming, watching any kind of content is a great experience as well. My previous TV was a now 4 year old 50 inch TCL Roku TV, which doesn't even come close to comparing in any way. This is my first time going for a high end more expensive TV like this and I'm very happy with my choice for sure. If you're looking to get a more premium display and you're a gamer as well then this is the one for you!"

Yes, they brought the TV into my home, yes they unpacked and attached the stand to the TV, yes they set the TV in place, and yes they took away all the debris. But after they left, I found two screws and three plastic mystery parts on the counter. Since everything seemed to be working perfectly and since nothing was falling apart, I just tossed these \"extra\" parts (I'm trying to NOT continue to throw stuff in our \"junk drawer\".\n\nThen last week I decided to replace our other aging TV with a second one of these great LG TVs. Concierge delivery was no longer an option so I unboxed and set up the TV myself (Youtube has several wonderful videos on this). It was simple and I immediately saw where the two missing screws should have been inserted in the TV stand. Also saw where the three missing plastic mystery pieces should have been attached.\n\nI don't think that these unused screws and cord holder plastic (mystery) pieces are an issue but I am surprised that the delivery guys, who said they set up these TV all the time, would have failed to finish these set-up details."

At least there are some options to do this that are on by default. Also check after every update cause they like to sneak in and reset these options.\nOther than that my experience has been great.

          "review": "The LG C3 OLED is the latest model in LG’s popular C series of OLED TVs, which have consistently delivered excellent picture quality and features for high-end shoppers or for shoppers looking for something closer in price to mid-range TVs while delivering S-tier performance. The C3 OLED boasts a sleek and minimalist design with an ultra-thin panel. The C3 OLED also supports four HDMI 2.1 inputs with various gaming features, such as 4K 120Hz, VRR, ALLM, FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync12. For the purposes of my review, we're going to focus on gaming, as that's been my overwhelming, primary use for this TV since it arrived and I got it all setup a little over a month ago. Here are my thoughts for the gamers reading this, and I hope it helps you make a decision -- this is for the 65\" model:\n\nThe LG C3 OLED is a great TV for gaming on various platforms, and I have connected and used virtually every type of gaming experience, such as PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X, and even my ROG Ally. Here are some details about its gaming performance:\n\n- The LG C3 OLED supports 4K 120Hz gaming on all four HDMI 2.1 ports, which means you can enjoy smooth and detailed gameplay on the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The TV also supports VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync, which can reduce screen tearing and stuttering and optimize the input lag.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a very low input lag of around 10ms, which is ideal for fast-paced games that require quick reactions. The TV also has a near-instant response time of less than 1ms, which means motion blur is minimal and action scenes are clear and crisp.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a wide color gamut and a high contrast ratio, which can deliver stunning HDR gaming with vivid colors and deep blacks. The TV supports Dolby Vision IQ, which can adjust the HDR picture based on the ambient light in the room, and HGiG, which can optimize the HDR gaming experience according to the TV's capabilities.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED can also handle lower-resolution gaming well, thanks to its upscaling technology that can enhance the image quality of 1080p or 1440p content. The TV can also play 8- and 16-bit games from the Nintendo Switch without any noticeable banding or artifacts.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a new feature called Game Optimizer, which is a dedicated menu that allows you to adjust various gaming settings, such as black stabilizer, white stabilizer, low latency mode, and sound mode. You can also access the Game Optimizer from the Magic Remote by pressing the Game Optimizer button.\n\nOverall, the LG C3 OLED is a versatile and impressive TV for gaming on different platforms, and it can provide a smooth, immersive, and enjoyable gaming experience that won't break the bank."

          "review": "This is my first OLED TV and all I can say is WOW! If you’ve only had LCD TVs in the past, the OLED difference is very noticeable with the infinite contrast and 3D look that it gives to the image. My biggest concern with this TV was that it wouldn’t be bright enough but even during the day with 3 windows shining light into the room I’ve found it’s plenty bright enough, and a lot brighter than the budget LCD TV I had before (Vizio M658-G1). LG supports everything you could want in terms of gaming with 4 HDMI 2.1 ports for 4k/120Hz Dolby Vision gaming, VRR, ALLM, etc. I play Xbox Series X on it and it looks amazing! I also play Nintendo Switch and with a few tweaks like upping sharpness to 15 and turning Super Resolution to high it looks almost 4k! Everything I’ve watched on it looks better than ever before and I can’t say enough good things about it. After considering all my options I decided on this TV over the other options:\n- Compared to the LG G3: A lot cheaper but with the same processor for equal upscaling and clarity. The G3 is noticeably brighter but, like I said, I haven’t felt like the C3 wasn’t bright enough and it was brighter than I expected\n- Compared to the Samsung S95C: Again, much cheaper and the processor is better than that on the S95C so lower quality content will look cleaner, especially lower bitrate like YouTube TV. The S95C is much brighter and more colorful but Samsung has quality control issues, poor firmware updates, and no Dolby Vision HDR support\n- Compared to LG C2: The C3 is very similar to the C2 and it’s hard to justify the price increase of the C3. It was worth it to me since I got a good deal and only paid a few hundred dollars more. The C3 has an improved processor with improved dynamic tone mapping with 20,000 zones instead of 5,000 and is a little bit brighter. It also supports DTS passthrough and QMS unlike the C2. A common complaint about LG OLEDs is their aggressive dimming during prolonged high APL scenes. That issue was fixed on the 2023 models. Lastly, the C3 has a new customizable quick access menu that’s nice for changing settings in a snap\n- Compared to Samsung S90C: This is the C3’s biggest competition this year because they are close in price. The S90C has the better QD-OLED panel and is brighter and more colorful. I went with the C3 because of the Samsung issues I mentioned above with the S95C. I just trust LG more than Samsung as a company to support their products for years to come. Also, QD-OLED appears to have more risk of burn-in and I like to keep my TVs for a long time\n- Compared to Samsung S95B (2022 model): I wanted a 77” TV and the S95B only comes in 55” and 65”. Also, Samsung issues I mentioned before\n\nConclusion: The C3 is probably the best all around OLED TV for most people. Everything I’ve watched on this looks incredible and LG is a brand you can trust when it comes to OLED. They’ve been making them longer than anyone else and they’ve figured out how to prevent burn-in for the vast majority of users. If all you do is watch news or sports channels all day long then OLED probably isn’t for you but if you watch a variety of content from movies, TV shows, gaming, etc then I think this might be the best TV you can buy. Unless you can afford the LG G3, of course"

          "review": " I had an old Vizio 50” for many years, I’d guess about 8 years. While I had the money, I just never wanted to spend it since the TV was fine for me.\n\nWell, I got some Christmas gifts that were money, with the express idea of helping me buy a TV. I chose this 65” LG OLED. It’s enormous, possibly too big for a 1Br apartment tbh, lol. I had to move my couch back a little bit.\n\nThe blacks are jet black, and the whites (simultaneously) are bright enough that it looks like glare coming from them. It’s a vast difference from my old TV. The picture is amazing, and it’s 120 Hz. Coupled with a PS5 (or Xbox, or PC) it’s awesome, it even has a substantial amount of gaming settings and a little gaming dashboard. It’s like a whole different experience than my old TV. It also has all of the modern smart TV features, including of course streaming services (I used to have to use my PS5 for HBO Max, but no longer).\n\nI love it tbh. It’s a lot of money for something that honestly would be fine at a lower quality offering, but I’m happy with it.\n\nIt was delivered with “chose the room” type of service, which I picked because I live on the second floor, so they carried it up for me. I set it up myself and disposed of the box/garbage.\n\nMake sure if you lift the top of the box off to get to the TV that you pull out the foam insert in the top of it, that’s where the remote and stuff is. Lifting the top off is best in case you want to save the box intact, but the foam piece is basically pressed in there, so you’ll have to carefully pull it out from the very top of the box. At first i thought I was missing stuff because I’m not the brightest.\n\nThe sound is like having small PC speakers with a subwoofer, it’s far beyond my old TV. It has very loud bass, not like older TVs.\n\nIf you haven’t upgraded in a while, it’s a pretty cool experience. It has a ton of features and settings. I love it, no issues so far and set up was extremely fast (I don’t have cable, I only use streaming stuff, so maybe that’s why). Slowest thing was downloading the LG app and making a profile, then connecting. Otherwise? Very fast and easy."

The picture is amazing and the sound output is so-so (as expected). We are currently using the apps on the LG TV. So far the LG apps are not bad but we may switch back to ROKU. Again, no surprise there since most reviews slam all of the TV app systems. The remote is really something for those of us who have not had a TV upgrade in a long time. Point it at the TV and a cursor appears to speed up navigation. Also does voice commands. The OK button in the middle of the navigation buttons is a wheel that allows you to scroll. It probably does more stuff that I haven't discovered yet. Nice remote. Great TV."

However when I searched to install the app it was not available, when I called LG customer service they said I need to purchase a Firestick or Roku in order to get the app. LG apparently doesn’t have an agreement with Dish TV to allow the app to be installed. Frustrating since I paid $1,000 for a “smart tv” and it can’t deliver a basic app. Now I have to purchase a Firestick which seems redundant (and a waste) for a brand new smart TV."

          "review": "This is pure OLED. Nothing better. Every other TV tech over the last 20 years has been a workaround for NOT being OLED. Mini-LED is as close as it gets to OLED and it still pales in comparison to OLED.\n\nOLED is pure, unadulterated picture. Combined with modern processing, 120Hz, 4K+ and modern connectivity and smart features and you have a powerhouse, beastly TV.\n\nGorgeous frame. 1/4” thin screen is mind bending. Premium OLED branding on back of TV, Stand and more.\n\nThe picture is absolutely gorgeous. Infinite contrast down to the single pixel level. Expression enhancer and tone mapping make it look 3D jumping off the screen when viewing certain content. I’m upgrading from a 60” LG 4K LED HDR from 2016 that had some serious internal problems. It’s a world of difference now.\n\nI will say, LG’s picture presets take A LOT of manipulating and adjusting to get your perfect preferred settings for each one. ( it saves it and says “User settings” in parentheses after you adjust it. So you know you’ve changed it. ) If you don’t know what you are doing or what to look for in these settings you will be losing out on precious image quality. I’m not sure why they let these panels ship with such horribly calibrated settings when these are part of their premium OLED line. But it’s not a huge issue. Just takes some time and input. If you don’t have the knowledge do some quick research online and you’ll be good to go.\n\nIt’s worth the premium. Don’t go back to LCD tech. Backlights are terrible."

It has plenty of options to adapt settings yourself. It works perfectly with my surround sound system. It adapts well to the programmed content and maximizes broadcast offerings. I love how it can function as both a \"still\" and \"moving art frame\" as well, with content that is \"always on\" in low power and improves the look of your living space. Handles all incoming data from my console seamlessly. Handles all \"technological handshakes\" like a pro! Plenty of HDMI 2.1 connections! Very thin, sleek and sharp design! Light! Amazing product!"

You basically are signing your life & privacy away to use this TV. Sign up is convoluted & difficult, significantly hampered by the remote constantly switching modes between pointer & digital pad mode.\n\nOut of the box, once you get past all the activation menu's, default settings for filmmaker mode does not have those nice inky blacks, it is about equivolent to a high grade VA panel levels light bleed. Trying to find & use settings to correct this without affecting peak brightness was quite time consuming but I was able to finally accomplish that. Please note that part of my difficulty setting this up is due to my age related shakiness & having had a previous stroke which affected me physically but not intellectually.\n\nOnce I finally got this set up the picture was everything I was hoping it would be. Definately brighter than my LG 27\" OLED monitor in its most accurate settings.\n\nOnce properly set up the picture can at times take on a 3D like appearance without any grayish haze that you get with even they best LCD type TV's or monitors including those with the mini LED type backlights. Granted it is quite subtle but still there on the mini LED type TV's.\n\nOnce you get past set up issues this is quite possibly the best TV in it's size class.\n\nIf it was just based on picture alone it would get 5 stars but set up issues & remote functionality & ease of use down grade this to 4 stars.\n\nNote; that to experience the best viewing one should be in a darkened room as due to its inky blacks & amount of detail in the dark areas of the screen which is the way movies were meant to be watched anyway."

It’s a glossy tv not Matt finish which I like and the screen reduces glare quite a bit over my last tv. It has a pinkish violet color to the light reflection I think it cuts the white light reflected down by having it be a bit darker it still reflects some light but I can actually watch tv or movies with the lights on and not be annoyed. For serious watching like a movie I turn off the background lights in my room. But daytime viewing is excellent. oled is amazing I have top of the line Sony mini led and it is no competition. At the store I couldn’t tell the difference but at home where it’s not super bright lit room like a store I can see the difference\n\nAdd says they ship out in one day but it didn’t ship for 4-5 days but it did arrive on time the date it said it would. So i can’t fault them for that.\n\nSeller had lowest price anywhere. I think I got a special deal by luck but I do want to give them credit for great pricing.\n\nI would purchase from them again."

Even aside from gaming, watching any kind of content is a great experience as well. My previous TV was a now 4 year old 50 inch TCL Roku TV, which doesn't even come close to comparing in any way.

          "review": "The LG C3 OLED is the latest model in LG’s popular C series of OLED TVs, which have consistently delivered excellent picture quality and features for high-end shoppers or for shoppers looking for something closer in price to mid-range TVs while delivering S-tier performance. The C3 OLED boasts a sleek and minimalist design with an ultra-thin panel. The C3 OLED also supports four HDMI 2.1 inputs with various gaming features, such as 4K 120Hz, VRR, ALLM, FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync12. For the purposes of my review, we're going to focus on gaming, as that's been my overwhelming, primary use for this TV since it arrived and I got it all setup a little over a month ago. Here are my thoughts for the gamers reading this, and I hope it helps you make a decision -- this is for the 65\" model:\n\nThe LG C3 OLED is a great TV for gaming on various platforms, and I have connected and used virtually every type of gaming experience, such as PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X, and even my ROG Ally. Here are some details about its gaming performance:\n\n- The LG C3 OLED supports 4K 120Hz gaming on all four HDMI 2.1 ports, which means you can enjoy smooth and detailed gameplay on the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The TV also supports VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync, which can reduce screen tearing and stuttering and optimize the input lag.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a very low input lag of around 10ms, which is ideal for fast-paced games that require quick reactions. The TV also has a near-instant response time of less than 1ms, which means motion blur is minimal and action scenes are clear and crisp.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a wide color gamut and a high contrast ratio, which can deliver stunning HDR gaming with vivid colors and deep blacks. The TV supports Dolby Vision IQ, which can adjust the HDR picture based on the ambient light in the room, and HGiG, which can optimize the HDR gaming experience according to the TV's capabilities.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED can also handle lower-resolution gaming well, thanks to its upscaling technology that can enhance the image quality of 1080p or 1440p content. The TV can also play 8- and 16-bit games from the Nintendo Switch without any noticeable banding or artifacts.\n\n- The LG C3 OLED has a new feature called Game Optimizer, which is a dedicated menu that allows you to adjust various gaming settings, such as black stabilizer, white stabilizer, low latency mode, and sound mode. You can also access the Game Optimizer from the Magic Remote by pressing the Game Optimizer button.\n\nOverall, the LG C3 OLED is a versatile and impressive TV for gaming on different platforms, and it can provide a smooth, immersive, and enjoyable gaming experience that won't break the bank."

          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "This is my first OLED TV and all I can say is WOW! If you’ve only had LCD TVs in the past, the OLED difference is very noticeable with the infinite contrast and 3D look that it gives to the image. My biggest concern with this TV was that it wouldn’t be bright enough but even during the day with 3 windows shining light into the room I’ve found it’s plenty bright enough, and a lot brighter than the budget LCD TV I had before (Vizio M658-G1). LG supports everything you could want in terms of gaming with 4 HDMI 2.1 ports for 4k/120Hz Dolby Vision gaming, VRR, ALLM, etc. I play Xbox Series X on it and it looks amazing! I also play Nintendo Switch and with a few tweaks like upping sharpness to 15 and turning Super Resolution to high it looks almost 4k! Everything I’ve watched on it looks better than ever before and I can’t say enough good things about it. After considering all my options I decided on this TV over the other options:\n- Compared to the LG G3: A lot cheaper but with the same processor for equal upscaling and clarity. The G3 is noticeably brighter but, like I said, I haven’t felt like the C3 wasn’t bright enough and it was brighter than I expected\n- Compared to the Samsung S95C: Again, much cheaper and the processor is better than that on the S95C so lower quality content will look cleaner, especially lower bitrate like YouTube TV. The S95C is much brighter and more colorful but Samsung has quality control issues, poor firmware updates, and no Dolby Vision HDR support\n- Compared to LG C2: The C3 is very similar to the C2 and it’s hard to justify the price increase of the C3. It was worth it to me since I got a good deal and only paid a few hundred dollars more. The C3 has an improved processor with improved dynamic tone mapping with 20,000 zones instead of 5,000 and is a little bit brighter. It also supports DTS passthrough and QMS unlike the C2. A common complaint about LG OLEDs is their aggressive dimming during prolonged high APL scenes. That issue was fixed on the 2023 models. Lastly, the C3 has a new customizable quick access menu that’s nice for changing settings in a snap\n- Compared to Samsung S90C: This is the C3’s biggest competition this year because they are close in price. The S90C has the better QD-OLED panel and is brighter and more colorful. I went with the C3 because of the Samsung issues I mentioned above with the S95C. I just trust LG more than Samsung as a company to support their products for years to come. Also, QD-OLED appears to have more risk of burn-in and I like to keep my TVs for a long time\n- Compared to Samsung S95B (2022 model): I wanted a 77” TV and the S95B only comes in 55” and 65”. Also, Samsung issues I mentioned before\n\nConclusion: The C3 is probably the best all around OLED TV for most people. Everything I’ve watched on this looks incredible and LG is a brand you can trust when it comes to OLED. They’ve been making them longer than anyone else and they’ve figured out how to prevent burn-in for the vast majority of users. If all you do is watch news or sports channels all day long then OLED probably isn’t for you but if you watch a variety of content from movies, TV shows, gaming, etc then I think this might be the best TV you can buy. Unless you can afford the LG G3, of course"

          "review": " I had an old Vizio 50” for many years, I’d guess about 8 years. While I had the money, I just never wanted to spend it since the TV was fine for me.\n\nWell, I got some Christmas gifts that were money, with the express idea of helping me buy a TV. I chose this 65” LG OLED. It’s enormous, possibly too big for a 1Br apartment tbh, lol. I had to move my couch back a little bit.\n\nThe blacks are jet black, and the whites (simultaneously) are bright enough that it looks like glare coming from them. It’s a vast difference from my old TV. The picture is amazing, and it’s 120 Hz. Coupled with a PS5 (or Xbox, or PC) it’s awesome, it even has a substantial amount of gaming settings and a little gaming dashboard. It’s like a whole different experience than my old TV. It also has all of the modern smart TV features, including of course streaming services (I used to have to use my PS5 for HBO Max, but no longer).\n\nI love it tbh. It’s a lot of money for something that honestly would be fine at a lower quality offering, but I’m happy with it.\n\nIt was delivered with “chose the room” type of service, which I picked because I live on the second floor, so they carried it up for me. I set it up myself and disposed of the box/garbage.\n\nMake sure if you lift the top of the box off to get to the TV that you pull out the foam insert in the top of it, that’s where the remote and stuff is. Lifting the top off is best in case you want to save the box intact, but the foam piece is basically pressed in there, so you’ll have to carefully pull it out from the very top of the box. At first i thought I was missing stuff because I’m not the brightest.\n\nThe sound is like having small PC speakers with a subwoofer, it’s far beyond my old TV. It has very loud bass, not like older TVs.\n\nIf you haven’t upgraded in a while, it’s a pretty cool experience. It has a ton of features and settings. I love it, no issues so far and set up was extremely fast (I don’t have cable, I only use streaming stuff, so maybe that’s why). Slowest thing was downloading the LG app and making a profile, then connecting. Otherwise? Very fast and easy."

The picture is amazing and the sound output is so-so (as expected). We are currently using the apps on the LG TV. So far the LG apps are not bad but we may switch back to ROKU. Again, no surprise there since most reviews slam all of the TV app systems. The remote is really something for those of us who have not had a TV upgrade in a long time. Point it at the TV and a cursor appears to speed up navigation. Also does voice commands. The OK button in the middle of the navigation buttons is a wheel that allows you to scroll. It probably does more stuff that I haven't discovered yet. Nice remote. Great TV."

Once you learn it, it is fine - or switch to voice control after setting up your favorites and leave the remote in a drawer."

However when I searched to install the app it was not available, when I called LG customer service they said I need to purchase a Firestick or Roku in order to get the app. LG apparently doesn’t have an agreement with Dish TV to allow the app to be installed. Frustrating since I paid $1,000 for a “smart tv” and it can’t deliver a basic app. Now I have to purchase a Firestick which seems redundant (and a waste) for a brand new smart TV."

          "review": "This is pure OLED. Nothing better. Every other TV tech over the last 20 years has been a workaround for NOT being OLED. Mini-LED is as close as it gets to OLED and it still pales in comparison to OLED.\n\nOLED is pure, unadulterated picture. Combined with modern processing, 120Hz, 4K+ and modern connectivity and smart features and you have a powerhouse, beastly TV.\n\nGorgeous frame. 1/4” thin screen is mind bending. Premium OLED branding on back of TV, Stand and more.\n\nThe picture is absolutely gorgeous. Infinite contrast down to the single pixel level. Expression enhancer and tone mapping make it look 3D jumping off the screen when viewing certain content. I’m upgrading from a 60” LG 4K LED HDR from 2016 that had some serious internal problems. It’s a world of difference now.\n\nI will say, LG’s picture presets take A LOT of manipulating and adjusting to get your perfect preferred settings for each one. ( it saves it and says “User settings” in parentheses after you adjust it. So you know you’ve changed it. ) If you don’t know what you are doing or what to look for in these settings you will be losing out on precious image quality. I’m not sure why they let these panels ship with such horribly calibrated settings when these are part of their premium OLED line. But it’s not a huge issue. Just takes some time and input. If you don’t have the knowledge do some quick research online and you’ll be good to go.\n\nIt’s worth the premium. Don’t go back to LCD tech. Backlights are terrible."

You can depend on this television to actually work as advertised, and save your valuable time buying the wrong products and returning them later. In the past, I'd be hesitant to connect other products online, but this one has functioned without interruption. So far, updates serve the system well! It adapts to the content being played. It has plenty of options to adapt settings yourself. It works perfectly with my surround sound system. It adapts well to the programmed content and maximizes broadcast offerings. I love how it can function as both a \"still\" and \"moving art frame\" as well, with content that is \"always on\" in low power and improves the look of your living space. Handles all incoming data from my console seamlessly. Handles all \"technological handshakes\" like a pro! Plenty of HDMI 2.1 connections! Very thin, sleek and sharp design! Light! Amazing product!"

You basically are signing your life & privacy away to use this TV. Sign up is convoluted & difficult, significantly hampered by the remote constantly switching modes between pointer & digital pad mode.\n\nOut of the box, once you get past all the activation menu's, default settings for filmmaker mode does not have those nice inky blacks, it is about equivolent to a high grade VA panel levels light bleed. Trying to find & use settings to correct this without affecting peak brightness was quite time consuming but I was able to finally accomplish that. Please note that part of my difficulty setting this up is due to my age related shakiness & having had a previous stroke which affected me physically but not intellectually.\n\nOnce I finally got this set up the picture was everything I was hoping it would be. Definately brighter than my LG 27\" OLED monitor in its most accurate settings.\n\nOnce properly set up the picture can at times take on a 3D like appearance without any grayish haze that you get with even they best LCD type TV's or monitors including those with the mini LED type backlights. Granted it is quite subtle but still there on the mini LED type TV's.\n\nOnce you get past set up issues this is quite possibly the best TV in it's size class.\n\nIf it was just based on picture alone it would get 5 stars but set up issues & remote functionality & ease of use down grade this to 4 stars.\n\nNote; that to experience the best viewing one should be in a darkened room as due to its inky blacks & amount of detail in the dark areas of the screen which is the way movies were meant to be watched anyway."

But it arrived and looks great not worth sending back to swap once I got it.\n\nAnti glare is pretty good. It’s a glossy tv not Matt finish which I like and the screen reduces glare quite a bit over my last tv. It has a pinkish violet color to the light reflection I think it cuts the white light reflected down by having it be a bit darker it still reflects some light but I can actually watch tv or movies with the lights on and not be annoyed. For serious watching like a movie I turn off the background lights in my room. But daytime viewing is excellent. oled is amazing I have top of the line Sony mini led and it is no competition. At the store I couldn’t tell the difference but at home where it’s not super bright lit room like a store I can see the difference\n\nAdd says they ship out in one day but it didn’t ship for 4-5 days but it did arrive on time the date it said it would. So i can’t fault them for that.\n\nSeller had lowest price anywhere. I think I got a special deal by luck but I do want to give them credit for great pricing.\n\nI would purchase from them again."

Then the game optimizer mode that brings it all conveniently together in one menu. In my opinion, this is the best TV around right now for gaming. Even aside from gaming, watching any kind of content is a great experience as well. My previous TV was a now 4 year old 50 inch TCL Roku TV, which doesn't even come close to comparing in any way. This is my first time going for a high end more expensive TV like this and I'm very happy with my choice for sure.

Its amazing for all those things.\n\nOffice use:\nI was worried about text clarity and general size issues but I quickly got used to this giant 42\" montitor in place of my dual monitor setup. You can easily snap 4 windows to each corner and be super productive\n\nGaming:\nThe game optimizer feature is really nice. VRR works very well, and ofc it looks amazing. It feels super immersive for rpg/adventure games. Probably too big for fps games though.\n\nTV:\nIts a quality oled display, cant really go wrong with movies and video in general"

We have had no problems with daytime viewing in a fairly bright room. I wanted to bypass LG’s opening screen and WebOS, which I was able to do with a little work and a SofaBaton U2 Universal Remote. Probably could have also done this with the LG Magic Remote and a little patience. All in all, great picture for a pretty reasonable price for an OLED TV."

          "review": "While this TV is spectacular, I had a small issue with the full-service concierge delivery. Yes, they brought the TV into my home, yes they unpacked and attached the stand to the TV, yes they set the TV in place, and yes they took away all the debris. But after they left, I found two screws and three plastic mystery parts on the counter. Since everything seemed to be working perfectly and since nothing was falling apart, I just tossed these \"extra\" parts (I'm trying to NOT continue to throw stuff in our \"junk drawer\".\n\nThen last week I decided to replace our other aging TV with a second one of these great LG TVs. Concierge delivery was no longer an option so I unboxed and set up the TV myself (Youtube has several wonderful videos on this). It was simple and I immediately saw where the two missing screws should have been inserted in the TV stand. Also saw where the three missing plastic mystery pieces should have been attached.\n\nI don't think that these unused screws and cord holder plastic (mystery) pieces are an issue but I am surprised that the delivery guys, who said they set up these TV all the time, would have failed to finish these set-up details."

There is a higher level LG G-3 supposed to be brighter, if that is your main concern, but no reason to spend 1k more....and G3 tech is new. I have enjoyed this tv like no other I have experienced before. My advice: do some research on Sony and Samsung but keep these important aspects in mind. This TV has better protection against burn in and is brighter."

I dont like the trend of spyware built into these TVs so they can keep making money off of us even after we spent an arm and a leg on the hardware its self.\nDO yourself a favor and disable these to the best you can. At least there are some options to do this that are on by default. Also check after every update cause they like to sneak in and reset these options.\nOther than that my experience has been great. Considering all the major manufactures are building in these \"smart\" features, there's not much you can do about that part.\nI use external stream boxes mainly because of this. They aren't really any better though."

Going from a 120\" screen projected by an Optoma HD28HDR to this is a night and day difference. The vibrancy this tv offers is truly wonderful! Who knew downsizing could be this exciting!! My recommendation, if you're in the market for the best quality TV and can't quite justify spending $5000 on the M3 model, this C3 is 100% the way to go. Best price to quality on the market as of 01/2024"

If you do not get a incredible picture after these settings just return the Tv as you most likely received a Tv with a bad panel. We have the Tv in a dark room 10 x12 with a Vizio sound bar through the earc. The dolby Atmos and digital sound is outstanding. Watching Jack Reacher on prime which is streamed with Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision is outstanding. Buy it and enjoy!"

          "review": "LG really did an incredible job with this TV! Everything is fully functional and working properly. My only concern is that when I play games on my Nintendo Switch, it turns off without warning me that it's overheating. I'm currently working that out as best I can. Other than that, I really enjoy the picture quality with the MLA layer and 4K HDR content.\nI also like that it's Dolby Vision and Atmos compatible for AMAZING picture and sound! The colors are bright and vibrant, the black details are perfectly pitch black instead of a washed out gray, and the sound is loud with my sound bar. It even makes DVDs, for example, look their best. I mainly use this TV for gaming on my PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch, and watching 4K movies via my PS5. I also enjoy live TV, streaming, and I found an Office option that pulls up documents for books I write. It doesn't, however, with the documents, connect to a printer, but that's to be expected, I have a laptop I use anyway.\nWith this TV, I also can use two set up HDMI devices at the same time with Multi View. In order to access Multi View for two devices, click the settings button once, scroll to Multi View, select Dual PC Monitor, and select the two inputs you want to use. No need for two screens and a matrix like I had before\nThe Art Gallery is also very neat to look at since it looks like a large picture frame on the wall when you select it. It doesn't let you upload your photos from your phone to LG's Art Gallery app, but if you have LG Thinq on your phone or a flash drive hooked up, it will let you see your photos.\nIn conclusion, I think it's the best TV ever! It can do so many things. I highly recommend it over any traditional TVs if you're in the market for something high quality"

I am upgrading from a 2020 Sony X950H which is a solid 4K LED tv that punches well above its class, but even without a resolution upgrade, the G3 absolutely stomps on it. Blacks on this TV are pure and inky, and highlight detail just pops like nothing else. Then, when you plug in your PS5 or XSX, you are treated to low input lag and punchy colors. VRR works particularly well and adds new life to games like Flight Simulator. Input delay feels near instantaneous for FPS games, and Dolby Vision hits you in the face like a sledgehammer. There are only 3 very minor complaints I have about this TV:\n1. If you’re using toslink to your AV receiver, uncompressed 5.1 signals are sent as PCM instead of bitstream, so you lose multichannel support (at least out of the box, and I haven’t been able to figure out how to change this)\n2. 1440p is not supported by default as an EDID resolution, so you won’t be able to get the most out of an mClassic if you don’t spend more on an EDID emulator.\n3. This tv does not ship with a stand, and the LG one suffers from instability and a significant lean-back. You have to spend more on a 3rd party one. I have a Sanus stand that works well\n\nOther than those minor gripes, the TV is extremely impressive, and I am proud to show it off to family and friends!"

Sound, not sure of the tv speakers because mine is playing through a Sonus system, and that works very well. This tv only has a wall mounting bracket included so if you need a stand be sure to order that item separately. LG makes a stand for it but that stand has a peculiar lean that I didn't care for so I mounted it on a Sanus tv stand and its perfectly stable and vertical and I couldn't be happier. Wonderful tv, I would highly recommend it."

          "review": "I purchased this 55\" LG G3 TV to replace a 13-year-old lCD TV. A smaller size would have worked better but 55\" is the smallest size made in this model. I bought this TV because of the professional review ratings it received online and I am quite pleased. This is my first smart TV so it took a day or so to sleuth-out it's capabilities. I use a Roku Ultra and a Bluray DVD player connected via high-speed HDMI cable and also an Over-The-Air (OTA) 75-Ohm antenna (which was easy to scan for available channels). The LG Home Hub App (pre-installed) makes it easy to choose which input source I want to view from. I have sampled some really high-definition content as well as some of the low-def OTA broadcasts and I am quite pleased at how good this TV makes all sources look. The reviewers all said that the \"Cinema\" picture mode was most accurate, but my wife and I both like the \"Standard\" picture mode best. I have enabled AI Sound Pro and enabled the Bass Boost feature and I find the sound quality quite good and clear at low sound levels. I haven't yet created a DHCP reservation for it in my network router to avoid it disconnecting from my network, but I plan to do that soon (I use hard-wired Ethernet RJ-45 6E cable). The re-run of BattleBots I'm watching right now looks so real it is just like being there in person."

In reality it is notably brighter and fine to view in a fairly bright room.\n\nMy one complaint is with WebOS. I find it very unintuitive to use. I'm still struggling to figure out all the option settings. But I have confidence I will eventually figure it out.\n\nI currently have it on a stand. Eventually I would like to wall mount it. I'm still looking for details on how others have hidden all the wires."

          "review": "Spent a good amount of time reviewing this product before purchasing it. Lots of YouTube time. This TV is an upgrade from my four year old LG 65in OLED and it is as advertised in every way. I am simply amazed how good this TV is and with its look on my wall. I had it professionally installed but only because I moved my entire entertainment system to an opposite wall and changed from a 7.1 channel setup to 9.2 with all the wiring behind the walls and running through the attic. Otherwise I could have easily installed it on the wall with the help from a buddy. One issue of note...it DID NOT come with the magic remote! It came with the basic LG remote. I remember reading a review from another customer who had the same issue. Without this remote, there are some important functions that cannot be accessed on the TV (voice, pointer, magic touch to activate screensaver, etc.) Here's why this product still gets FIVE STARS, I contacted Amazon support who credited me the cost of the magic remote and referred me to LG support who promptly sent me the remote. Unbelievable customer service! Overall a great purchase and experience for me. Hope this review was helpful...Happy holidays."

As soon as we got the aftermarket (from Amazon) tabletop mount brackets installed, we slid it on top of my bedroom Armoire and we powered it up, my friend, and I, were both STUNNED by the picture quality that come on that screen. I'm installing my LG S95QR-9.1.5 810 watts home theater surround sound system today. So far, I simply cannot be more impressed, this TV went right into its set up mode, connected it to my WIFI and it began updating and also asked me to connect to a plethora of different apps that I would like. This replaced my 15-year-old Sharp 46-inch LCD flat screen TV. I highly recommend this TV, and as many others have stated, prepare to be blown away! Five full stars. Just amazing!"

I was a UPS driver before for years. No problem. I backed the Kubota to the fence. No damage. I was thrilled. No run around. I will never question ordering a a big item again.\nI ordered a recliner through Amazon also a year ago. Best experience. The locals could care less about service.\nThe lg g3 is fantastic.

One of the first shows I watched was \"Heart of Stone\" (Netflix) after sunset and the HDR is amazing. A few scenes went from bright to BLACK and it gave me the chills.\n\nThe brightness of the screen when hit with DIRECT sunlight in the AM is watchable. (see the photos)\n\nDuring the day when some light leakage is seen from the blinds, I can see reflections but they don't bother ME. The anti-glare works well enough and black is still black."

          "review": "LG really did an incredible job with this TV! Everything is fully functional and working properly. My only concern is that when I play games on my Nintendo Switch, it turns off without warning me that it's overheating. I'm currently working that out as best I can. Other than that, I really enjoy the picture quality with the MLA layer and 4K HDR content.\nI also like that it's Dolby Vision and Atmos compatible for AMAZING picture and sound! The colors are bright and vibrant, the black details are perfectly pitch black instead of a washed out gray, and the sound is loud with my sound bar. It even makes DVDs, for example, look their best. I mainly use this TV for gaming on my PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch, and watching 4K movies via my PS5. I also enjoy live TV, streaming, and I found an Office option that pulls up documents for books I write. It doesn't, however, with the documents, connect to a printer, but that's to be expected, I have a laptop I use anyway.\nWith this TV, I also can use two set up HDMI devices at the same time with Multi View. In order to access Multi View for two devices, click the settings button once, scroll to Multi View, select Dual PC Monitor, and select the two inputs you want to use. No need for two screens and a matrix like I had before\nThe Art Gallery is also very neat to look at since it looks like a large picture frame on the wall when you select it. It doesn't let you upload your photos from your phone to LG's Art Gallery app, but if you have LG Thinq on your phone or a flash drive hooked up, it will let you see your photos.\nIn conclusion, I think it's the best TV ever! It can do so many things. I highly recommend it over any traditional TVs if you're in the market for something high quality"

It was easy to mount on my wall, just make sure you have two to three guys to help because the 77\" weighs over a 100 lbs and the size of it makes it challenging when putting it on the wall mount. It looks great on the wall. I highly recommend this TV."

We get a red light, but all the power buttons do is turn the light off for a second then turns back on. No screen. Amazon refused to replace and instead offered a 10% partial refund to handle the warranty repair through LG. If LG can't repair it or replace it, I still have the option for a full refund before January. Huge bummer as the TV looks incredible."

          "review": "The LG G3 OLED is a superb viewing experience, particularly for those fond of gaming. I am upgrading from a 2020 Sony X950H which is a solid 4K LED tv that punches well above its class, but even without a resolution upgrade, the G3 absolutely stomps on it. Blacks on this TV are pure and inky, and highlight detail just pops like nothing else. Then, when you plug in your PS5 or XSX, you are treated to low input lag and punchy colors. VRR works particularly well and adds new life to games like Flight Simulator. Input delay feels near instantaneous for FPS games, and Dolby Vision hits you in the face like a sledgehammer. There are only 3 very minor complaints I have about this TV:\n1. If you’re using toslink to your AV receiver, uncompressed 5.1 signals are sent as PCM instead of bitstream, so you lose multichannel support (at least out of the box, and I haven’t been able to figure out how to change this)\n2. 1440p is not supported by default as an EDID resolution, so you won’t be able to get the most out of an mClassic if you don’t spend more on an EDID emulator.\n3. This tv does not ship with a stand, and the LG one suffers from instability and a significant lean-back. You have to spend more on a 3rd party one. I have a Sanus stand that works well\n\nOther than those minor gripes, the TV is extremely impressive, and I am proud to show it off to family and friends!"

Sound, not sure of the tv speakers because mine is playing through a Sonus system, and that works very well. This tv only has a wall mounting bracket included so if you need a stand be sure to order that item separately. LG makes a stand for it but that stand has a peculiar lean that I didn't care for so I mounted it on a Sanus tv stand and its perfectly stable and vertical and I couldn't be happier. Wonderful tv, I would highly recommend it."

          "review": "I purchased this 55\" LG G3 TV to replace a 13-year-old lCD TV. A smaller size would have worked better but 55\" is the smallest size made in this model. I bought this TV because of the professional review ratings it received online and I am quite pleased. This is my first smart TV so it took a day or so to sleuth-out it's capabilities. I use a Roku Ultra and a Bluray DVD player connected via high-speed HDMI cable and also an Over-The-Air (OTA) 75-Ohm antenna (which was easy to scan for available channels). The LG Home Hub App (pre-installed) makes it easy to choose which input source I want to view from. I have sampled some really high-definition content as well as some of the low-def OTA broadcasts and I am quite pleased at how good this TV makes all sources look. The reviewers all said that the \"Cinema\" picture mode was most accurate, but my wife and I both like the \"Standard\" picture mode best. I have enabled AI Sound Pro and enabled the Bass Boost feature and I find the sound quality quite good and clear at low sound levels. I haven't yet created a DHCP reservation for it in my network router to avoid it disconnecting from my network, but I plan to do that soon (I use hard-wired Ethernet RJ-45 6E cable). The re-run of BattleBots I'm watching right now looks so real it is just like being there in person."

I'm still struggling to figure out all the option settings. But I have confidence I will eventually figure it out.\n\nI currently have it on a stand. Eventually I would like to wall mount it.

          "review": "Spent a good amount of time reviewing this product before purchasing it. Lots of YouTube time. This TV is an upgrade from my four year old LG 65in OLED and it is as advertised in every way. I am simply amazed how good this TV is and with its look on my wall. I had it professionally installed but only because I moved my entire entertainment system to an opposite wall and changed from a 7.1 channel setup to 9.2 with all the wiring behind the walls and running through the attic. Otherwise I could have easily installed it on the wall with the help from a buddy. One issue of note...it DID NOT come with the magic remote! It came with the basic LG remote. I remember reading a review from another customer who had the same issue. Without this remote, there are some important functions that cannot be accessed on the TV (voice, pointer, magic touch to activate screensaver, etc.) Here's why this product still gets FIVE STARS, I contacted Amazon support who credited me the cost of the magic remote and referred me to LG support who promptly sent me the remote. Unbelievable customer service! Overall a great purchase and experience for me. Hope this review was helpful...Happy holidays."

I'm installing my LG S95QR-9.1.5 810 watts home theater surround sound system today. So far, I simply cannot be more impressed, this TV went right into its set up mode, connected it to my WIFI and it began updating and also asked me to connect to a plethora of different apps that I would like. This replaced my 15-year-old Sharp 46-inch LCD flat screen TV. I highly recommend this TV, and as many others have stated, prepare to be blown away! Five full stars. Just amazing!"

I was a UPS driver before for years. No problem. I backed the Kubota to the fence. No damage. I was thrilled. No run around. I will never question ordering a a big item again.\nI ordered a recliner through Amazon also a year ago. Best experience. The locals could care less about service.\nThe lg g3 is fantastic.

One of the first shows I watched was \"Heart of Stone\" (Netflix) after sunset and the HDR is amazing. A few scenes went from bright to BLACK and it gave me the chills.\n\nThe brightness of the screen when hit with DIRECT sunlight in the AM is watchable. (see the photos)\n\nDuring the day when some light leakage is seen from the blinds, I can see reflections but they don't bother ME. The anti-glare works well enough and black is still black."

          "review": "LG really did an incredible job with this TV! Everything is fully functional and working properly. My only concern is that when I play games on my Nintendo Switch, it turns off without warning me that it's overheating. I'm currently working that out as best I can. Other than that, I really enjoy the picture quality with the MLA layer and 4K HDR content.\nI also like that it's Dolby Vision and Atmos compatible for AMAZING picture and sound! The colors are bright and vibrant, the black details are perfectly pitch black instead of a washed out gray, and the sound is loud with my sound bar. It even makes DVDs, for example, look their best. I mainly use this TV for gaming on my PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch, and watching 4K movies via my PS5. I also enjoy live TV, streaming, and I found an Office option that pulls up documents for books I write. It doesn't, however, with the documents, connect to a printer, but that's to be expected, I have a laptop I use anyway.\nWith this TV, I also can use two set up HDMI devices at the same time with Multi View. In order to access Multi View for two devices, click the settings button once, scroll to Multi View, select Dual PC Monitor, and select the two inputs you want to use. No need for two screens and a matrix like I had before\nThe Art Gallery is also very neat to look at since it looks like a large picture frame on the wall when you select it. It doesn't let you upload your photos from your phone to LG's Art Gallery app, but if you have LG Thinq on your phone or a flash drive hooked up, it will let you see your photos.\nIn conclusion, I think it's the best TV ever! It can do so many things. I highly recommend it over any traditional TVs if you're in the market for something high quality"

It was easy to mount on my wall, just make sure you have two to three guys to help because the 77\" weighs over a 100 lbs and the size of it makes it challenging when putting it on the wall mount. It looks great on the wall. I highly recommend this TV."

We get a red light, but all the power buttons do is turn the light off for a second then turns back on. No screen. Amazon refused to replace and instead offered a 10% partial refund to handle the warranty repair through LG. If LG can't repair it or replace it, I still have the option for a full refund before January. Huge bummer as the TV looks incredible."

          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "The LG G3 OLED is a superb viewing experience, particularly for those fond of gaming. I am upgrading from a 2020 Sony X950H which is a solid 4K LED tv that punches well above its class, but even without a resolution upgrade, the G3 absolutely stomps on it. Blacks on this TV are pure and inky, and highlight detail just pops like nothing else. Then, when you plug in your PS5 or XSX, you are treated to low input lag and punchy colors. VRR works particularly well and adds new life to games like Flight Simulator. Input delay feels near instantaneous for FPS games, and Dolby Vision hits you in the face like a sledgehammer. There are only 3 very minor complaints I have about this TV:\n1. If you’re using toslink to your AV receiver, uncompressed 5.1 signals are sent as PCM instead of bitstream, so you lose multichannel support (at least out of the box, and I haven’t been able to figure out how to change this)\n2. 1440p is not supported by default as an EDID resolution, so you won’t be able to get the most out of an mClassic if you don’t spend more on an EDID emulator.\n3. This tv does not ship with a stand, and the LG one suffers from instability and a significant lean-back. You have to spend more on a 3rd party one. I have a Sanus stand that works well\n\nOther than those minor gripes, the TV is extremely impressive, and I am proud to show it off to family and friends!"

Sound, not sure of the tv speakers because mine is playing through a Sonus system, and that works very well. This tv only has a wall mounting bracket included so if you need a stand be sure to order that item separately. LG makes a stand for it but that stand has a peculiar lean that I didn't care for so I mounted it on a Sanus tv stand and its perfectly stable and vertical and I couldn't be happier. Wonderful tv, I would highly recommend it."

          "review": "I purchased this 55\" LG G3 TV to replace a 13-year-old lCD TV. A smaller size would have worked better but 55\" is the smallest size made in this model. I bought this TV because of the professional review ratings it received online and I am quite pleased. This is my first smart TV so it took a day or so to sleuth-out it's capabilities. I use a Roku Ultra and a Bluray DVD player connected via high-speed HDMI cable and also an Over-The-Air (OTA) 75-Ohm antenna (which was easy to scan for available channels). The LG Home Hub App (pre-installed) makes it easy to choose which input source I want to view from. I have sampled some really high-definition content as well as some of the low-def OTA broadcasts and I am quite pleased at how good this TV makes all sources look. The reviewers all said that the \"Cinema\" picture mode was most accurate, but my wife and I both like the \"Standard\" picture mode best. I have enabled AI Sound Pro and enabled the Bass Boost feature and I find the sound quality quite good and clear at low sound levels. I haven't yet created a DHCP reservation for it in my network router to avoid it disconnecting from my network, but I plan to do that soon (I use hard-wired Ethernet RJ-45 6E cable). The re-run of BattleBots I'm watching right now looks so real it is just like being there in person."

In reality it is notably brighter and fine to view in a fairly bright room.\n\nMy one complaint is with WebOS. I find it very unintuitive to use. I'm still struggling to figure out all the option settings. But I have confidence I will eventually figure it out.\n\nI currently have it on a stand. Eventually I would like to wall mount it. I'm still looking for details on how others have hidden all the wires."

          "review": "Spent a good amount of time reviewing this product before purchasing it. Lots of YouTube time. This TV is an upgrade from my four year old LG 65in OLED and it is as advertised in every way. I am simply amazed how good this TV is and with its look on my wall. I had it professionally installed but only because I moved my entire entertainment system to an opposite wall and changed from a 7.1 channel setup to 9.2 with all the wiring behind the walls and running through the attic. Otherwise I could have easily installed it on the wall with the help from a buddy. One issue of note...it DID NOT come with the magic remote! It came with the basic LG remote. I remember reading a review from another customer who had the same issue. Without this remote, there are some important functions that cannot be accessed on the TV (voice, pointer, magic touch to activate screensaver, etc.) Here's why this product still gets FIVE STARS, I contacted Amazon support who credited me the cost of the magic remote and referred me to LG support who promptly sent me the remote. Unbelievable customer service! Overall a great purchase and experience for me. Hope this review was helpful...Happy holidays."

I'm installing my LG S95QR-9.1.5 810 watts home theater surround sound system today. So far, I simply cannot be more impressed, this TV went right into its set up mode, connected it to my WIFI and it began updating and also asked me to connect to a plethora of different apps that I would like. This replaced my 15-year-old Sharp 46-inch LCD flat screen TV. I highly recommend this TV, and as many others have stated, prepare to be blown away! Five full stars. Just amazing!"

I was a UPS driver before for years. No problem. I backed the Kubota to the fence. No damage. I was thrilled. No run around. I will never question ordering a a big item again.\nI ordered a recliner through Amazon also a year ago. Best experience. The locals could care less about service.\nThe lg g3 is fantastic.

One of the first shows I watched was \"Heart of Stone\" (Netflix) after sunset and the HDR is amazing. A few scenes went from bright to BLACK and it gave me the chills.\n\nThe brightness of the screen when hit with DIRECT sunlight in the AM is watchable. (see the photos)\n\nDuring the day when some light leakage is seen from the blinds, I can see reflections but they don't bother ME. The anti-glare works well enough and black is still black."

          "review": "LG really did an incredible job with this TV! Everything is fully functional and working properly. My only concern is that when I play games on my Nintendo Switch, it turns off without warning me that it's overheating. I'm currently working that out as best I can. Other than that, I really enjoy the picture quality with the MLA layer and 4K HDR content.\nI also like that it's Dolby Vision and Atmos compatible for AMAZING picture and sound! The colors are bright and vibrant, the black details are perfectly pitch black instead of a washed out gray, and the sound is loud with my sound bar. It even makes DVDs, for example, look their best. I mainly use this TV for gaming on my PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch, and watching 4K movies via my PS5. I also enjoy live TV, streaming, and I found an Office option that pulls up documents for books I write. It doesn't, however, with the documents, connect to a printer, but that's to be expected, I have a laptop I use anyway.\nWith this TV, I also can use two set up HDMI devices at the same time with Multi View. In order to access Multi View for two devices, click the settings button once, scroll to Multi View, select Dual PC Monitor, and select the two inputs you want to use. No need for two screens and a matrix like I had before\nThe Art Gallery is also very neat to look at since it looks like a large picture frame on the wall when you select it. It doesn't let you upload your photos from your phone to LG's Art Gallery app, but if you have LG Thinq on your phone or a flash drive hooked up, it will let you see your photos.\nIn conclusion, I think it's the best TV ever! It can do so many things. I highly recommend it over any traditional TVs if you're in the market for something high quality"

It was easy to mount on my wall, just make sure you have two to three guys to help because the 77\" weighs over a 100 lbs and the size of it makes it challenging when putting it on the wall mount. It looks great on the wall. I highly recommend this TV."

We get a red light, but all the power buttons do is turn the light off for a second then turns back on. No screen. Amazon refused to replace and instead offered a 10% partial refund to handle the warranty repair through LG. If LG can't repair it or replace it, I still have the option for a full refund before January. Huge bummer as the TV looks incredible."

          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "The LG G3 OLED is a superb viewing experience, particularly for those fond of gaming. I am upgrading from a 2020 Sony X950H which is a solid 4K LED tv that punches well above its class, but even without a resolution upgrade, the G3 absolutely stomps on it. Blacks on this TV are pure and inky, and highlight detail just pops like nothing else. Then, when you plug in your PS5 or XSX, you are treated to low input lag and punchy colors. VRR works particularly well and adds new life to games like Flight Simulator. Input delay feels near instantaneous for FPS games, and Dolby Vision hits you in the face like a sledgehammer. There are only 3 very minor complaints I have about this TV:\n1. If you’re using toslink to your AV receiver, uncompressed 5.1 signals are sent as PCM instead of bitstream, so you lose multichannel support (at least out of the box, and I haven’t been able to figure out how to change this)\n2. 1440p is not supported by default as an EDID resolution, so you won’t be able to get the most out of an mClassic if you don’t spend more on an EDID emulator.\n3. This tv does not ship with a stand, and the LG one suffers from instability and a significant lean-back. You have to spend more on a 3rd party one. I have a Sanus stand that works well\n\nOther than those minor gripes, the TV is extremely impressive, and I am proud to show it off to family and friends!"

Sound, not sure of the tv speakers because mine is playing through a Sonus system, and that works very well. This tv only has a wall mounting bracket included so if you need a stand be sure to order that item separately. LG makes a stand for it but that stand has a peculiar lean that I didn't care for so I mounted it on a Sanus tv stand and its perfectly stable and vertical and I couldn't be happier. Wonderful tv, I would highly recommend it."

          "review": "I purchased this 55\" LG G3 TV to replace a 13-year-old lCD TV. A smaller size would have worked better but 55\" is the smallest size made in this model. I bought this TV because of the professional review ratings it received online and I am quite pleased. This is my first smart TV so it took a day or so to sleuth-out it's capabilities. I use a Roku Ultra and a Bluray DVD player connected via high-speed HDMI cable and also an Over-The-Air (OTA) 75-Ohm antenna (which was easy to scan for available channels). The LG Home Hub App (pre-installed) makes it easy to choose which input source I want to view from. I have sampled some really high-definition content as well as some of the low-def OTA broadcasts and I am quite pleased at how good this TV makes all sources look. The reviewers all said that the \"Cinema\" picture mode was most accurate, but my wife and I both like the \"Standard\" picture mode best. I have enabled AI Sound Pro and enabled the Bass Boost feature and I find the sound quality quite good and clear at low sound levels. I haven't yet created a DHCP reservation for it in my network router to avoid it disconnecting from my network, but I plan to do that soon (I use hard-wired Ethernet RJ-45 6E cable). The re-run of BattleBots I'm watching right now looks so real it is just like being there in person."

I'm still struggling to figure out all the option settings. But I have confidence I will eventually figure it out.\n\nI currently have it on a stand. Eventually I would like to wall mount it. I'm still looking for details on how others have hidden all the wires."

This TV is an upgrade from my four year old LG 65in OLED and it is as advertised in every way. I am simply amazed how good this TV is and with its look on my wall. I had it professionally installed but only because I moved my entire entertainment system to an opposite wall and changed from a 7.1 channel setup to 9.2 with all the wiring behind the walls and running through the attic. Otherwise I could have easily installed it on the wall with the help from a buddy. One issue of note...it DID NOT come with the magic remote! It came with the basic LG remote. I remember reading a review from another customer who had the same issue. Without this remote, there are some important functions that cannot be accessed on the TV (voice, pointer, magic touch to activate screensaver, etc.) Here's why this product still gets FIVE STARS, I contacted Amazon support who credited me the cost of the magic remote and referred me to LG support who promptly sent me the remote. Unbelievable customer service! Overall a great purchase and experience for me. Hope this review was helpful...Happy holidays."

I'm installing my LG S95QR-9.1.5 810 watts home theater surround sound system today. So far, I simply cannot be more impressed, this TV went right into its set up mode, connected it to my WIFI and it began updating and also asked me to connect to a plethora of different apps that I would like. This replaced my 15-year-old Sharp 46-inch LCD flat screen TV. I highly recommend this TV, and as many others have stated, prepare to be blown away! Five full stars. Just amazing!"

I will never question ordering a a big item again.\nI ordered a recliner through Amazon also a year ago. Best experience. The locals could care less about service.\nThe lg g3 is fantastic.

One of the first shows I watched was \"Heart of Stone\" (Netflix) after sunset and the HDR is amazing. A few scenes went from bright to BLACK and it gave me the chills.\n\nThe brightness of the screen when hit with DIRECT sunlight in the AM is watchable. (see the photos)\n\nDuring the day when some light leakage is seen from the blinds, I can see reflections but they don't bother ME. The anti-glare works well enough and black is still black."

          "review": "Should preface when I turned it on there was some texturing in the middle when all solid colors. This is somewhat normal. I did a pixel cleaning and it was 100% gone and haven’t noticed anything else. If this happens it’s alright it’s normal AND the panel does this cleaning automatically after being turned off. So you will notice if your screen has been on for a couple hours turning it off will not make the same click. It will then click off idk 20 minutes later with a little light at the bottom. Just wanted to preface with that knowledge as I feel I’m a bit more technologically inclined and was still a bit spooked by the texture. Now onto the actual tv. The panel looks perfect. HDR is really bright, colors pop, and blacks are perfect. Features include auto low latency mode meaning a pc or console connection instantly turns it to lowest latency. The input lag on this tv is lower than any panel I’ve ever used even a TN 144hz panel. Airplay 2 support means you can “cast” 1080p 60 hdr video with no loss of quality. I have to be honest even 720p video looks freaking awesome on this due to the super sampling. I personally also enjoy the interpolation this tv provides. Little to actually no artifacts with just fluid motion. Everything has worked correctly and consistently with this TV. This tv is perfect for gaming imo. Such low latency and VRR, GSync, and freesync all work correctly. No flickering, works all way down to 20hz, and even works correctly with my nividia gpu. Additionally this tv even supports Bluetooth if you want to not have the speakers going. The speakers though sound much better than I was expecting I have no desire to get any external equipment. They are very full and no mud even with super low or high frequencies. I’m not saying it’s better than a sound bar I’m just saying it’s definitely the best TV speakers I’ve ever heard. This review is a bit all round but honestly this tv is worth far more than the 1.3k I paid for the 55inch. When it came out it was high high 2k range. It has that level of quality and personally I wouldn’t even look at the c3 or g3 unless these are sold out. In short out of 100 I’d give it 100/100 this isn’t a rounding 5/5 it’s truly perfect and I have no complaints. Get it trust me you won’t be disappointed in the product."

          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "NOTE: LG recently released a firmware update to the LG C2 that substantially reduces the ABL auto-dimming! This makes it much more competitive to the PG4*UQ and other OLEDs without opening the service menu to disable those features.\n\nI hear a lot of issues people have with using a TV as a monitor, especially this one, but I haven't had any such issues. After setting it up properly, the only problem is the RWBG subpixel layout and having to turn it on along with my computer. But as someone that grew up with CRT monitors, having to press an extra button in addition to the power button is not even the slightest bit inconvenient. The thing that really kills this as a monitor is the subpixel layout.\nRWBG adds noticeable fringing and bleed on text on OSes calibrated for RGB subpixels. Turning subpixel rendering compensation off makes it tolerable, but it's still much harder to read than on a normal monitor, and some games use it regardless of OS settings with no obvious way to adjust it. For visual content like movies and games it isn't noticeable at all, however.\nAs long as you aren't planning to read a whole bunch, or if you sit further back and make your text bigger so the subpixels don't mess with the text as much, there isn't a single issue with using this as a computer monitor.\n\nI originally purchased the PG42UQ and PG48UQ instead, and got 2 dead 42's and one 48 that only survived for a few weeks before it spontaneously died. I'd like to compare some points on the C2 vs PG4*UQ:\n- The box on the C2 is thicker, the Styrofoam completely protects the screen unlike on the PG4*UQ where there are tons of gaps, the Styrofoam on the corners is also much thicker preventing drops from affecting the corners like what happened to BOTH of my PG42UQs, and the accessories and feet are placed in sane location unlike the strange Styrofoam origami that was both the PG42UQ and PG48UQ.\n- On both, the panel quality is fantastic. But on the C2, you can really tweak the settings until everything is perfect, especially if you have the service remote or other way to get into the service menu. This TV in particular can easily be color calibrated to make it shine in whatever environment you put it in with 22 point white balance adjustment, gamma curves, and multiple black/white level boosts and compensations.\n- The glossy screen is a boon as it leaves the blacks completely dark, vs. a matte screen like on the PG4*UQ where there is significant light bleed and blooming.\n- The C2's panel is much thicker and doesn't feel fragile compared to the dangerously paper-thin, basically unprotected edges on the PG4*UQ\n- The power button housing on the bottom doesn't bend easily and feel like it's going to snap off like on the PG4*UQ. It's also much thinner and less obnoxious to look at. Man, I hate \"gamer\" stuff.\n- In general, the design on the C2 is much more sleek, simple, and modern, allowing it to fit into the room better than the eye-catching \"gamer\" aesthetic on the PG4*UQ.\n- Due to the thicker panel backplate and rear cover design, the C2 is easier to lift safely without feeling like you're going to damage it.\n- All the cable managing on the C2 is in one spot on one side only, instead of top, right, and bottom.\n- With the right settings in Game Optimizer mode, the C2 can reach the same point-for-point performance metrics as the PG4*UQ, with only the peak brightness not being as good (but that doesn't matter as it dips substantially for both the second a scene starts getting bright, after which the difference is negligible).\n- The subpixel layout on the PG4*UQ is better for reading text. This is the only praise I have for it over the C2.\n- The refresh rate can be overclocked on the PG4*UQ to a staggering 138Hz! Wow, how impressive. Unfortunately, the difference visually between 120Hz and 138Hz is basically nonexistent, as someone that has compared the C2 at 120Hz and PG48UQ at 138Hz. The response time is still fantastic on both units regardless of mode.\n\nOverall, highly recommend this as both a TV and a monitor. I don't use the smart features and leave it disconnected from the network, and unlike with other smart TV platforms, the C2 doesn't annoy you and simply lets you use it without the smart feature bloat impeding you. And if I want to consume content and use the motion smoothing etc. features, they're there at a press of the button. I don't think all the massive number of problems with the ASUS units make the overclocking or other small extra features worth it; and at the same time, the C2 offers some nice features of its own that the PG4*UQ doesn't have. I would highly recommend it as a multimon replacement as I am, if you're willing to live with the subpixel layout and having to turn the TV on and off separately to the connected PC; do note there is a Windows-only, community-maintained companion app, which I can't use as I don't use Windows."

From the moment I placed the order to the prompt delivery, everything went incredibly smoothly.\n\nFirst and foremost, the TV itself is a gem. The picture quality is absolutely breathtaking, with vibrant colors and crisp details that bring every scene to life. The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience. I find myself completely immersed in my favorite movies and TV shows, thanks to this remarkable television.\n\nWhat truly sets this seller apart, though, is their exceptional customer service. Throughout the entire process, they were attentive, responsive, and went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction. They promptly answered all my pre-purchase questions, providing detailed information and expert advice to help me make an informed decision. Their dedication to customer satisfaction was evident from start to finish.\n\nFurthermore, the packaging was done with utmost care and attention to detail. The TV arrived in perfect condition, securely protected against any potential damage during transit. It was evident that the seller takes great pride in their products and values the customer's experience.\n\nI also appreciated the easy setup process. The instructions provided were clear and concise, allowing me to have the TV up and running in no time. It's always a pleasure when a product lives up to its promises, and this TV certainly exceeded my expectations.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase from this seller on Amazon. They have proven themselves to be reliable, trustworthy, and committed to delivering an exceptional customer experience. If you're in the market for a new TV, I highly recommend considering their offerings. I will undoubtedly turn to them for any future electronic needs. Kudos to the seller for their outstanding product and impeccable service!"

          "review": "Version: 77 inch\nSeller: Amazon\nDelivery by: NSD (more about this at the bottom)\nPhoto 1: 68\" width. Will need large tv stand to look \"right\".\nPhoto 2: Mid-day reflection handling.\nPhoto 3: Inputs are on the left side of the set. Thin screen, but a wider portion holds the internals.\n\nFirst, the product.\n\nThe picture is fantastic. Viewing high bit-rate content such as Blu-rays is amazing. Ultra HD (2160p) HDR content is flawless and Full HD (1080p) SDR content is handled well. I like the upscaling of my Nvidia Shield for 1080p-> 4K upscaling over the TV’s, but most individuals will find no issues. The ability to turn off pixels for true black allows for an amazing contrast of color and blacks.\n\nThis TV supports high frame rate video game consoles with up to 120 FPS and offers a variable refresh rate (VRR) for gaming that isn’t locked at a steady 120/60/30 FPS. VRR ensures that games that support it will appear smoother and free of the screen tearing that is normally associated with frame rates that don’t match the TV. For PS5 owners, this means games that support a 40 FPS mode can be fully enjoyed on this TV. For PC owners, your 60-120 FPS experience will be similar to a good monitor, plus the amazing features of a top-tier TV. Also, input latency while in game mode is untouchable by non-OLED displays.\n\nThe TV speakers sound fine for daytime TV programming, but I utilize the TV’s eARC feature to send audio to my sound system. This feature works fine and is only a menu toggle away. Unfortunately, I can’t speak on the audio performance beyond this.\n\nThe set handles reflections well, but that doesn’t mean they disappear. This brings me to my one issue with this set, which is an issue shared with most OLEDs. OLED does not get extremely bright. If you intend to use this set in a living room with many windows, I suggest black-out curtains for the best viewing. If you cannot control the light in your room, I recommend considering a high-end LED TV instead, as they can get much brighter than OLEDs.\n\nAs for the TV’s operating system, I find the remote’s “motion as a mouse pointer” a little annoying sometimes, but hardly worth docking stars. Very usable system. The TV handles streaming 4K content from YouTube, Disney, Plex, and other services without issue. The perk of a major brand is knowing popular apps will work without a problem. This remains the case with this set.\n\nLastly, I must discuss my delivery experience. A special freight delivery service is needed for a delivery item of this size. NSD handled fulfillment. My experience was abysmal.\n\nDelivery must be scheduled. A signature is required for delivery, and the item will be placed inside your door (allegedly). NSD was a no-call and no-show on the day of delivery, and they did not reach out to reschedule. I attempted to call NSD for rescheduling three times, was hung up on twice by their system while waiting, and the third time resulted in being told that the local office would call to reschedule. After three more days of no contact, I had to contact chat support another three times over three days, asking to be contacted to reschedule. The second chat said NSD would escalate my delivery due to a no-call no-show. The third chat let me know that had not been done but assured me that they would. The sixth time is the charm. Delivery tracking showed the TV in town for an entire week before delivery was “attempted” and another week before the company finally called to deliver (no rescheduling of delivery, just delivery with only a few minutes warning). I live on a military installation, and the delivery team said they were not able to come onto the installation. This can be the result of several things: a lie, laziness, criminal history of one or both delivery members, or drugs/weapons in the delivery vehicle. As the company did not call to reschedule, I was out of town when they called me for delivery. Fortunately, I had a coworker I trusted to accept delivery off-base and hold the TV at his home until I was able to return.\n\nAs the delivery was not fulfilled by Amazon and the product itself is great, I am not deducting from my rating for this experience. However, let this be a horror story of delivery for potential buyers of the 77” version. If you have to buy online because you are rural like me, select NSD as an absolute last resort. A $2,400 purchase can be quite stressful when no one wants to talk to you about its delivery."

          "review": "After lots of online research and in-store viewing I settled on a previous year model 77\" screen OLED, the LGC2-PUA (not for WalMart or Cosco) model. It has more features than I will regularly use and has the best features of the things I want. The newer G2 isn't really a better product if you can get this model.\n\nI settled on this early for picture quality, but hesitated because other reviews noted the interface as difficult or annoying. Then, I discovered some online videos showing hidden menu features to simplify the display and eliminate those same annoyances that others complained about, but apparently missed the tips on. The menu does SOME self-explaining, but you will need to read about the effects if you want to go mess with a DIY calibration for your room. Default isn't too bad, but there are lots of tweaks you can use to get the best in your home.\n\nI have 81 near-flawless hours on the set after gaining operating tips online for tweaking settings. It displays well even in moderately bright day, as long as direct sun isn't hitting the screen, Evening viewing is quite stunning allowing a change of settings for more depth and color. The screen can be very reflective of lamps and other light sources, but we have overhead lighting so don't have an issue there. Off-axis viewing is decent especially in the vertical as we can watch from the upstairs internal balcony. The unit has a self-cleaning feature at shutdown that refreshes pixels every few hours so that burn-in isn't likely.\n\nSet-up was quick and we followed basic LG advice for unpacking. The stand went on easily but does require two people; one to to position & hold the screen until the through-screws can anchor the pedestal to the set. A/V connectors are placed on the side and easily accessible. Premium-capacity HDMI WILL BE a necessary expense to preserve best quality, but there are many reasonably-priced options.\n\nWe route sound to wired, external speakers with a Denon AVR but the TV sound is not too bad with the AI tweaks built-in, and would work OK in a small room setting.\n\nIt WAS more than I intended to spend (after the existing 2014 65\" plasma died) but has been well-worth the money in quality and performance."

          "rating": "4.0",
          "review": "This really is the best picture quality in the biz. Anything better is only by a small margin in very technical ways that very few users will notice, or need very specific types of scenes in order to display their upper hand. I have a few Samsung QLED displays of varying quality and this blows them away (although Neo QLEDs are closer in match, still not that close). I was sick of inconsistent blacks, backlighting blooming, and other typical LED issues and this TV does not have any of those issues. But I left a little wanting on the software. Here's the breakdown.\n\nPicture Quality 5/5:\nIt's simply the best. Viewing angles are great, contrast is great, HDR and Dolby Vision content is looks spectacular, backlighting is perfect. I had issues with all of these items on my Samsung QLEDs - the blacks and backlighting just completely drove me nuts with those, especially in dark scenes. Practically no viewing angle on a QLED, this you can look at it from 178 degrees with no color degradation. New OLEDs are pretty bright - I live near Phoenix AZ so it's bright everyday, and this is in a North facing living room with big windows. I leave my blinds open all day in there and there are no issues with brightness. So don't listen to people who say it's not bright enough, unless maybe you plan on using this outside in the sun. I will say that the front is more of a reflective glossy surface, so keep in mind lights behind you that may reflect on the tv. I also thought I damaged the panel mounting it to the wall because there were a lot of vertical lines when I turned it on, especially on the left, but after running the Pixel Cleaning cycle on the OLED Panel Care menu the lines completely went away so that's kinda cool.\n\nSoftware 4/5:\nI do like the software on Samsung better. This isn't BAD per-say... it just isn't great. Menus are as clean and easy as the Samsung home screen, or the mini menu that pops over the current content (I don't think LG even has that, just goes to the main home screen). I have a Samsung frame, and that gallery software blows the LG gallery software out of the water. Also not sure you can really compare because a true gallery option isn't really an option due to OLED burn in - you really don't want it displaying one image all day. Alexa kinda doesn't work as well as my Samsung as well. However, I do like that it shows as always on so that I can beam some Airplay content from my phone while the tv is off and it just turns on and goes to my selection.\n\nRemote 4/5:\nEh it's fine. I like the pointer feature, it's better than a wii remote, but if you accidentally scroll the center button instead of click when not using the pointer it switches to pointer and that's annoying. It's also huge! Well, by modern standards. Apple TV remotes are small and maybe too sparse on buttons, but I like the new Samsung remotes that are slim and have the solar charger on the back. They are also bluetooth so you don't need an IR line-of-sight to work. There are a ton of unnecessary buttons on the LG remote. They need to sexy it up and simplify the button layout and switch to BT instead of IR and that would get them back into the modern day remote.\n\nSound 3/5:\nIt's fine - all modern tvs are bad cause they are so slim but this is actually ok. I use their S90QY soundbar/subwoofer so not an issue for me (separate review for that). But why would you buy this tv and go for sub-par sound? Go treat yourself to a nice hometheater, you won't regret the addition.\n\nAesthetics 5/5:\nIt's pretty sexy. People who come over always comment on how thin it is. I have it mounted to the wall with a 0.6\" thick wall mount so that's about as close to the wall as you can get. The bezels are smaller than any other display I've seen. The stand it comes with is unnecessarily big and bulky in my opinion but yeah it looks better on the wall anyways. It's definitely a statement piece in the living room.\n\nDolby Atmos/Dolby Vision 5/5:\nWhenever I stream content that supports this format, it shows a little popover in the top right for a few seconds telling me that it's using that format and my soundbar switches to the right audio profile setting over the e-Arc connection, and the content looks and sounds perfect. Feels like I have the best home theater around. You have to try hard to find it's flaws. Best viewing experience I have ever had.\n\nSummary:\nBest in class viewing experience for the money. They could improve the software and remote a bit, but they aren't unusable and just take a bit of adjusting. Definitely need a good Dolby Atmos capable sound system to really maximize the experience. LG may have finally gotten me off Samsung displays, but now Samsung is hot on their heels with new OLED panels coming out. In 2023, I'd say buy LG C2 OLED (C3 only has marginal improvements for a higher price). We'll see who comes out on top in 2024."

          "review": "This TV is the absolute best I have ever owned, no question. It performs very well in dimly lit and brightly lit rooms. The picture is phenomenal, and I absolutely love the myriad of settings to fine-tune everything exactly how I want.\n\nI game pretty extensively, and my experience of this TV with my Playstation 5 has been excellent! It makes for a great gaming experience, can handle everything that the PS5 is capable of, and I simply love the 'game mode' that the TV has, complete with being able to select the type of game I am playing and it automatically adjusts several settings to match the game.\n\nA big plus for me is the screen burn prevention technology that this TV comes with. The ever so slight dimming of static displays on the screen (a HUD in virtually every game I play), and minor, periodic repositioning of those static images to help prevent screen burn are great! You legitimately don't even notice either feature unless you are really paying attention to it, but it does enough that I have yet to have a single issue with screen burn in the last nearly 4 months of heavy gaming. The TV looks just as good right now as it did when it first came out of the box.\n\nMy ONLY knock on this TV, and it is a relatively minor issue, is that is occasionally thinks I'm talking to it to issue a command when I'm simply gaming with friends. Can be a minor distraction when the prompt comes up on the screen, but it's not a major issue. I ensured that I have the setting off that would allow for hands-free Alexa control, instead opting for it to function under the push-and-hold of the Alexa button on the remote, but somehow that doesn't seem to stop the TV from infrequently trying to operate hands-free regardless. Again, not a huge issue, just a minor annoyance. Everything else that this TV offers far outweighs such a minor thing, so my rating remains at 5 stars.\n\nSimply put, if you want a fantastic OLED TV that definitely delivers on what it promises, the C2 is the way to go. I see that the C3 is about to launch, but the 65\" C2 at under $1700 is perfect for me. I don't have any desire to pay $2500 for the 65\" C3 for what is very likely a minor upgrade, if any at all. I'd have to imagine the C3 might have some software and/or UI changes that may somehow improve general quality-of-life, but I find it very unlikely that the screen quality and image quality of the C3 will be any different. Short of being an 8K resolution, there's nothing I can see where it could be improved. (8K is absolutely useless right now anyway; essentially no media content is in 8K).\n\nPerfect TV without draining your savings account! I may end up buying a second one for my bedroom, in all honesty. It's that good."

I have to squint my eyes. And if you're like most people who work a 9-5 and mostly watch tv in the evenings - you'll find it bright enough. Come on people.\n\nLet's start with the UGLY:\n\nCEC: NIGHTMARE\nI have a PS5, XBSX, Shield Pro. Whether these devices are all plugged into tv then ARC-> Yamaha receiver, -OR- everything plugged into a new Denon 760H receiver then eARC-> tv, it's equally faulty. The tv likes to turn on my PS5 whenever I hit the input button (it shows the row of inputs first like it should, but then turns on and switches to PS5, also whenever I hit the back button from the ThinQ menu (I need to remember to hit the HOME button instead) and other odd buttons it fires up the PS5. Last night it did this when I hit the settings button ?!? Cannot get the Shield Pro to turn the tv on when it powers on. Yet, it will turn the tv on when it's connected to my 10 year old Yamaha receiver (eARC to tv).\nThe Universal Control Management is terrible. So much bloated crap on this TV.\n\nAuto-resume?!? Pause while watching netflix. 3 minutes later it starts playing. Watching something on plex- exit to home screen. 5 min later it switches to Plex and resumes movie.\n\nALEXA: HORRIBLE\nThis has to be the WORST Alexa integration EVER. My 3 year old Sony 900h connected on day one and has been FLAWLESS. Same with my $400 TCL roku tv. I say \"Alexa, turn off xxx tv\" and it would work 100% of the time. NOT ON THIS TV. It took me a week to troubleshoot, uninstalling apps, reinstalling (why are there 2 different LG devices on the Alexa app?!?). I'd say it works 10% of the time. Usually it says \"LG tv is not responding, please check it's network and power connection). If I grab the LG remote and hit the Alexa button and tell it to turn off it will work. But I could obviously just hit the power button on the remote.\n\nUPDATE: try calling the Tv \"tv\" instead of \"lg tv\" . ALSO-\" the tv has its own Alexa built in. Our echo dots are all named \"echo\" so this actually works quite well. Try calling \"alexa\" to the tv and issuing command. This has been working lately rather than telling my dot \"echo, pause the tv\". We'll see tomorrow. /update. (This still only works 50% of the time. Usually says \" network error\". 3/19/23)\n\nLEARNING CURVE: STEEP AF\nMake sure to register at AVSFORUM and read up/post your questions. The menu settings are very confusing and oddly placed. Read the manual, do your research. Go onto RTINGS.\n\nREMOTE: LOVE/HATE\nThe pointer wheel is kind of cool and probably quicker most of the time. It's like using a Wii remote but far more accurate and stable. The problem is when you just want to click over and select something (by pressing the wheel in). But my finger slips and instead of pressing the wheel in it turns the wheel which brings up the pointer and takes much longer to do what I need to do. There's also no Play/Pause button, you need to press in the wheel.\n\nI consider myself a person of average intelligence but it's 2023 All remotes should have 3 things MANDATORY:\n1. ALL buttons need to light up when lifted (like the Shield remote).\n2. There ABSOLUTELY NEEDS to be a sliding LOCK BUTTON to prevent accidental button press (and kid mischief).\n3. It needs to have a remote finder. Go into the app, hit a button, the remote makes a sound.\n(4). It would be nice to have a few learning buttons and customizable app buttons, not just Netflix.\n\n\"Gallery\" feature is a missed opportunity. It only appears if you are on an external input after the device has been powered off. Or you can select the gallery app manually. Here's a stellar idea - why not use the gallery as the screensaver instead of the ugly fireworks or clock?\n\nGAMING: SUPERB\nPlaying Horizon Forbidden West on PS5 at 60+ FPS in 4K is absolutely ASSAULTING on the eyes. It looks incredible! TV is responsive in regards to input lag and response time. When the tv is in GAME MODE, hitting the options button on the TV brings up the GAME menu which shows you all the gaming-related options and displays the current FPS on screen. Very nice.\n\nMOVIES: OBJECTIVE\nNo TV is perfect. Side viewing angle is big for me. I can see the color washout sitting 12\" over on the couch while watching my Sony 900h LCD tv. Unacceptable. This TV has an AWESOME VIEWING ANGLE. Go to RTINGS to view and compare. There is no discernable color/luminance washout in any seat in my living room. You need to go off to the extreme right/left to notice it.\n\nMy dvd backups played via PLEX app on TV look incredible, thanks to the rich OLED blacks. 1080p BD rips also look fantastic (compared to my LCD SONY 900h). And of course 4k content looks great. We all know about the \"inky\" blacks of OLED, no need to talk about it. Image quality is the best I've seen.\n\nSTUTTER/(Judder?):\nThis is a big one for me. During panning shots, usually when there is something tall and thin not moving on the screen there is a HORRIBLE STUTTER effect. It's jaggy and looks like the picture can't keep up. It's extremely jarring and takes me right out of the experience. This is due to the extremely fast response time of OLED technology. I find it extremely undesirable and a flaw. Options to mitigate this will introduce the Soap Opera effect, which is worse IMO.\n\nSOUND OUTPUT\nSound on the tv is fine. The usual. Sound output via ARC/eARC will only output the basics: stereo, Atmos, Dolby Digital and (DD+) to your receiver. And there is a difference between this DD and the DD you will find on a DVD/Blu Ray. It's a much more boring, stripped-down version (as with the Atmos I have heard) It's a lower bitrate signal. But it will suffice if you're going for a true 1-remote system. The TV will NOT OUTPUT DTS, DTS-MA, DD True HD via ARC/eARC. ***UPDATE: RECENT NEWS INFORMED THAT LG MIGHT START OFFERING DTS OUTPUT VIA ARC. IT'S UNSURE WHETHER THIS TV WILL RECEIVE THIS UPDATE*** Go onto RTINGS to check this info. Most TV's these days do not support outputting hi res audio signals which is unfortunate. The Nvidia Shield Pro is the recommended set-top box if hi-res audio is important to you.\n\nwebOS: fine\nEveryone seems to hate on the webOS. Look, they ALL have ads. I much prefer the Google Android (SONY tv, Shield) OS. But this one is fine. It offers all the apps I need: Netflix HBO MAX, Hulu, Disney +, and all the other ones, and displays them in a row at the bottom of the screen. You can easily go to what you want without looking or noticing all the other ads and crap on the tv. There is also another \"ThinQ\" app home screen where you can look at more crap you will probably never use. I stay away from all of this and hit my buttons very precisely otherwise one wrong move and I will launch the PS5 or some other device via CEC.\n\nHINT: If your PS5 (maybe other devices too) does turn on, hit the (...) button on the LG remote to bring up a menu where you can put the PS5 back into sleep mode.\n\nEYES\nIt took about 6 weeks for my eyes to adjust to this tv. Not sure of it was the detail, the brightness (it's plenty bright for me) or the blue light - whatever - my eyes got strained. It felt like a dull pressure behind my eyeballs. I'm 43 and perhaps I have some eye issues, so this is objective. I'm sort of used to it now, however I do start to feel eye strain in excess of 2/3 hours. Sooner if gaming.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: WOULD I BUY THIS TV AGAIN?\nI don't think so, especially now with other brands (SONY) offering OLED. I just don't think I should have so much to complain about with a $2500 tv. I would expect it with HiSense, TCL, Westinghouse basement bargain garage sale tvs, but not with a top shelf LG OLED.\n\nI would NOT choose OLED if there was another tech that offered similar gaming response time, decent black levels, and NO STUTTER during panning shots. This is like right on the edge of being a deal-breaker for me.\n\n1/30/23 - I will update when/if things change. 3/19/23. I still hate this tv. Love the picture quality but just HATE the way it operates and all the shortcomings. No more LG for me."

          "reviewTitle": "LG makes a nice display, but a lousy TV",
          "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2023",
          "rating": "3.0",
          "review": "Yes, I didn't give this a great rating because the engineers made way too many amateurish mistakes in the user interface. To show why is a long review ...\n\nThis TV lacks ATSC 3.0. In the end, I didn't care much because when I downloaded the manual of a very popular competitor's TV that \"had\" ATSC 3.0, the manual stated it wouldn't decode the high def content! Wow--not very useful. So, I wondered how many other TVs had the same limitation that \"claimed\" ATSC 3.0 which is why I removed that as a requirement.\n\nI personally feel that we are approaching the point of diminishing returns on how good TV displays look. Case in point, I looked at the TVs at Walmart & Target, which cost 1/3 this one and they don't look bad. Yes, you can see some color shifting at extreme angles, but still, not bad. As for more expensive TVs, I looked at the various reviews out there and my take is that you can measure differences in display quality amongst the ones costing more or less the same, but unless the TVs are sitting side by side, I think the display difference is barely perceptible, if at all (some reviews actually mention this). In the end, I decided to focus on the user interface of the TVs, not rely on reviewer's measurements.\n\nBefore I go into the remote and user interaction I want to discuss the poor upconversion when watching 480i TV. The jaggies are readily apparent and so bad, small text is difficult to read. It's like all they did was double the pixels and did little interpolation. I attempted to take some pictures. One is from live TV and the other is the same program recorded (and interpolated) by my HTPC. My HTPC with 10 year old software and processor uses a very basic linear interpolation algorithm and it outperforms this TV when displaying this content.\n\nOne thing I noticed when looking at the various TVs was some remotes didn't have numbers. Wow. I'm a TV watcher. I couldn't imagine scrolling through channels trying to get to the one I want.\n\nThe remote is an RF one, but the TV does support an IR one (you lose the \"mouse like cursor\" and I think the \"mouse wheel\" though). The first thing you notice is the buttons are kind of small and close together. I have small hands, so I didn't care.\n\nThe layout is bad. They didn't even try. No excuse--they've been making remotes for how many decades?? The volume up/down paddle is on the left. Below it is the home button, NOT the mute button (the mute button is in the center, where the home button should be). The \"go back to previous channel\" button is on the left, not on the right where the channel up/down paddle is. What this means is you'll be looking at your remote a lot.\n\nThen you notice the various input selection \"types\": up/down \"paddles\" for volume and channels; a ring that can be pressed up/down and maybe left/right; a mouse-like wheel; and don't forget the \"mouse cursor\". Why all of them? It's like rather than do a quality exercise by having various people interact with it and give feedback so they could select one or two, they just used all of them. One problem is all the real estate wasted by this. The other issue is, and this is really weird: the different buttons only work in certain situations. For example, when you start typing a channel number, a list pops up with the channels it could be. You can use the ring to move the selection up/down, but NOT the mouse wheel--apparently, it's function is (apparently only) to scroll to the next channel you are currently watching--it won't work to move the selection up/down. And you can't use the mouse cursor either. It's darn right amateurish, by engineering standards. Think about using a PC/Mac app and in one spot, you had to use the up/down arrows; in another spot you use the mouse, in yet another, you used the mouse wheel. It's maddening and makes it hard to use.\n\nThe \"go back\" ONLY deals with TV channels. It should go back to what was previously displayed on the TV. For example, if you were watching HDMI input 3 and jumped to TV channel 3.2, pressing the \"go back\" button should take you back to HDMI input 3. This is nice because it's a hack to act as a screensaver if you pause the video on an HDMI input. This display suffers from image retention, so if you get up to make popcorn, for example, you don't want a still image. Since there's no \"screen saver\" button (hint), this hack works nicely to quickly jump back and forth. My old Panasonic TV did this and I used it all the time.\n\nThe cursor is nice (and it's fun to use). The mouse wheel works pretty well. I think they found the sweet spot for how hard it is to turn and falsely turning it. However, the wheel is a selection button as well, and a couple of times when scrolling I inadvertently pushed too hard and selected something I didn't want. Also, when scrolling through the up/down submenu for channel selection, I have hit that wheel causing a channel change that I didn't want.\n\nThe remote has a bunch of largish \"quick jump\" buttons on the bottom for jumping to various streaming services. However, they take up valuable real estate. I'd rather they were smaller or replaced by a row of smaller buttons you could program to the stream of choice. There's some small colored buttons (have yet to determine their purpose) and maybe they would suffice.\n\nThe RF remote has a voice input. I was looking forward to trying it out, but it only works if the TV is connected to the internet.\n\nWhen you power up an external device connected to HDMI, a popup appears asking if you want to go to that HDMI input. Nice, BUT, if you try to use the mouse wheel, it unselects the default \"Yes\", but doesn't select the other option (\"No\"). You have to use the ring for that.\n\nOne last note about the RF remote. There are a lot of clones for sale here and elsewhere. Beware. Some hint they are RF remotes when they aren't. And every non LG RF one I looked at appeared to be lacking a sticker on the back with the FCC ID. To be legal for sale/use in the U.S., each device emitting RF must have an FCC ID (that you can lookup) to verify it passed FCC tests. This is to ensure the safety of you and your neighbors. Imagine someone attached to some medical equipment that is interfered with by an illegal RF remote.\n\nUPDATE: I've had this awhile now. I've noticed glitches every now and then. Sometimes it's slow reacting to user input. It lost track of time (was like 10 hours off). I had to uncheck \"auto\" and set it manually to correct it. Time will tell if it will keep track of daylight savings time for me. Lastly, I was looking at the OTA content guide (\"what's on each channel\"--part of ATSC meta data). I moved the remote too quick which causes the cursor to display and then all the channel data blanked out. I had to exit out and come back in to get it to display the content.\n\nTo be fair--there have been two or three updates now for this TV (yikes--why so many?!). Maybe they fixed some of the glitches I'm seeing. However, I'm not a big fan of updating--my experience says you risk breaking something.\n\nAnd the weird layout of the remote is still driving me nuts. I wish a 3rd party would make a remote for these TVs."

          "review": "Should preface when I turned it on there was some texturing in the middle when all solid colors. This is somewhat normal. I did a pixel cleaning and it was 100% gone and haven’t noticed anything else. If this happens it’s alright it’s normal AND the panel does this cleaning automatically after being turned off. So you will notice if your screen has been on for a couple hours turning it off will not make the same click. It will then click off idk 20 minutes later with a little light at the bottom. Just wanted to preface with that knowledge as I feel I’m a bit more technologically inclined and was still a bit spooked by the texture. Now onto the actual tv. The panel looks perfect. HDR is really bright, colors pop, and blacks are perfect. Features include auto low latency mode meaning a pc or console connection instantly turns it to lowest latency. The input lag on this tv is lower than any panel I’ve ever used even a TN 144hz panel. Airplay 2 support means you can “cast” 1080p 60 hdr video with no loss of quality. I have to be honest even 720p video looks freaking awesome on this due to the super sampling. I personally also enjoy the interpolation this tv provides. Little to actually no artifacts with just fluid motion. Everything has worked correctly and consistently with this TV. This tv is perfect for gaming imo. Such low latency and VRR, GSync, and freesync all work correctly. No flickering, works all way down to 20hz, and even works correctly with my nividia gpu. Additionally this tv even supports Bluetooth if you want to not have the speakers going. The speakers though sound much better than I was expecting I have no desire to get any external equipment. They are very full and no mud even with super low or high frequencies. I’m not saying it’s better than a sound bar I’m just saying it’s definitely the best TV speakers I’ve ever heard. This review is a bit all round but honestly this tv is worth far more than the 1.3k I paid for the 55inch. When it came out it was high high 2k range. It has that level of quality and personally I wouldn’t even look at the c3 or g3 unless these are sold out. In short out of 100 I’d give it 100/100 this isn’t a rounding 5/5 it’s truly perfect and I have no complaints. Get it trust me you won’t be disappointed in the product."

          "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023",
          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "NOTE: LG recently released a firmware update to the LG C2 that substantially reduces the ABL auto-dimming! This makes it much more competitive to the PG4*UQ and other OLEDs without opening the service menu to disable those features.\n\nI hear a lot of issues people have with using a TV as a monitor, especially this one, but I haven't had any such issues. After setting it up properly, the only problem is the RWBG subpixel layout and having to turn it on along with my computer. But as someone that grew up with CRT monitors, having to press an extra button in addition to the power button is not even the slightest bit inconvenient. The thing that really kills this as a monitor is the subpixel layout.\nRWBG adds noticeable fringing and bleed on text on OSes calibrated for RGB subpixels. Turning subpixel rendering compensation off makes it tolerable, but it's still much harder to read than on a normal monitor, and some games use it regardless of OS settings with no obvious way to adjust it. For visual content like movies and games it isn't noticeable at all, however.\nAs long as you aren't planning to read a whole bunch, or if you sit further back and make your text bigger so the subpixels don't mess with the text as much, there isn't a single issue with using this as a computer monitor.\n\nI originally purchased the PG42UQ and PG48UQ instead, and got 2 dead 42's and one 48 that only survived for a few weeks before it spontaneously died. I'd like to compare some points on the C2 vs PG4*UQ:\n- The box on the C2 is thicker, the Styrofoam completely protects the screen unlike on the PG4*UQ where there are tons of gaps, the Styrofoam on the corners is also much thicker preventing drops from affecting the corners like what happened to BOTH of my PG42UQs, and the accessories and feet are placed in sane location unlike the strange Styrofoam origami that was both the PG42UQ and PG48UQ.\n- On both, the panel quality is fantastic. But on the C2, you can really tweak the settings until everything is perfect, especially if you have the service remote or other way to get into the service menu. This TV in particular can easily be color calibrated to make it shine in whatever environment you put it in with 22 point white balance adjustment, gamma curves, and multiple black/white level boosts and compensations.\n- The glossy screen is a boon as it leaves the blacks completely dark, vs. a matte screen like on the PG4*UQ where there is significant light bleed and blooming.\n- The C2's panel is much thicker and doesn't feel fragile compared to the dangerously paper-thin, basically unprotected edges on the PG4*UQ\n- The power button housing on the bottom doesn't bend easily and feel like it's going to snap off like on the PG4*UQ. It's also much thinner and less obnoxious to look at. Man, I hate \"gamer\" stuff.\n- In general, the design on the C2 is much more sleek, simple, and modern, allowing it to fit into the room better than the eye-catching \"gamer\" aesthetic on the PG4*UQ.\n- Due to the thicker panel backplate and rear cover design, the C2 is easier to lift safely without feeling like you're going to damage it.\n- All the cable managing on the C2 is in one spot on one side only, instead of top, right, and bottom.\n- With the right settings in Game Optimizer mode, the C2 can reach the same point-for-point performance metrics as the PG4*UQ, with only the peak brightness not being as good (but that doesn't matter as it dips substantially for both the second a scene starts getting bright, after which the difference is negligible).\n- The subpixel layout on the PG4*UQ is better for reading text. This is the only praise I have for it over the C2.\n- The refresh rate can be overclocked on the PG4*UQ to a staggering 138Hz! Wow, how impressive. Unfortunately, the difference visually between 120Hz and 138Hz is basically nonexistent, as someone that has compared the C2 at 120Hz and PG48UQ at 138Hz. The response time is still fantastic on both units regardless of mode.\n\nOverall, highly recommend this as both a TV and a monitor. I don't use the smart features and leave it disconnected from the network, and unlike with other smart TV platforms, the C2 doesn't annoy you and simply lets you use it without the smart feature bloat impeding you. And if I want to consume content and use the motion smoothing etc. features, they're there at a press of the button. I don't think all the massive number of problems with the ASUS units make the overclocking or other small extra features worth it; and at the same time, the C2 offers some nice features of its own that the PG4*UQ doesn't have. I would highly recommend it as a multimon replacement as I am, if you're willing to live with the subpixel layout and having to turn the TV on and off separately to the connected PC; do note there is a Windows-only, community-maintained companion app, which I can't use as I don't use Windows."

          "review": "I recently purchased a TV from this seller on Amazon, and I must say that the experience has been nothing short of outstanding. From the moment I placed the order to the prompt delivery, everything went incredibly smoothly.\n\nFirst and foremost, the TV itself is a gem. The picture quality is absolutely breathtaking, with vibrant colors and crisp details that bring every scene to life. The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience. I find myself completely immersed in my favorite movies and TV shows, thanks to this remarkable television.\n\nWhat truly sets this seller apart, though, is their exceptional customer service. Throughout the entire process, they were attentive, responsive, and went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction. They promptly answered all my pre-purchase questions, providing detailed information and expert advice to help me make an informed decision. Their dedication to customer satisfaction was evident from start to finish.\n\nFurthermore, the packaging was done with utmost care and attention to detail. The TV arrived in perfect condition, securely protected against any potential damage during transit. It was evident that the seller takes great pride in their products and values the customer's experience.\n\nI also appreciated the easy setup process. The instructions provided were clear and concise, allowing me to have the TV up and running in no time. It's always a pleasure when a product lives up to its promises, and this TV certainly exceeded my expectations.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase from this seller on Amazon. They have proven themselves to be reliable, trustworthy, and committed to delivering an exceptional customer experience. If you're in the market for a new TV, I highly recommend considering their offerings. I will undoubtedly turn to them for any future electronic needs. Kudos to the seller for their outstanding product and impeccable service!"

          "review": "Version: 77 inch\nSeller: Amazon\nDelivery by: NSD (more about this at the bottom)\nPhoto 1: 68\" width. Will need large tv stand to look \"right\".\nPhoto 2: Mid-day reflection handling.\nPhoto 3: Inputs are on the left side of the set. Thin screen, but a wider portion holds the internals.\n\nFirst, the product.\n\nThe picture is fantastic. Viewing high bit-rate content such as Blu-rays is amazing. Ultra HD (2160p) HDR content is flawless and Full HD (1080p) SDR content is handled well. I like the upscaling of my Nvidia Shield for 1080p-> 4K upscaling over the TV’s, but most individuals will find no issues. The ability to turn off pixels for true black allows for an amazing contrast of color and blacks.\n\nThis TV supports high frame rate video game consoles with up to 120 FPS and offers a variable refresh rate (VRR) for gaming that isn’t locked at a steady 120/60/30 FPS. VRR ensures that games that support it will appear smoother and free of the screen tearing that is normally associated with frame rates that don’t match the TV. For PS5 owners, this means games that support a 40 FPS mode can be fully enjoyed on this TV. For PC owners, your 60-120 FPS experience will be similar to a good monitor, plus the amazing features of a top-tier TV. Also, input latency while in game mode is untouchable by non-OLED displays.\n\nThe TV speakers sound fine for daytime TV programming, but I utilize the TV’s eARC feature to send audio to my sound system. This feature works fine and is only a menu toggle away. Unfortunately, I can’t speak on the audio performance beyond this.\n\nThe set handles reflections well, but that doesn’t mean they disappear. This brings me to my one issue with this set, which is an issue shared with most OLEDs. OLED does not get extremely bright. If you intend to use this set in a living room with many windows, I suggest black-out curtains for the best viewing. If you cannot control the light in your room, I recommend considering a high-end LED TV instead, as they can get much brighter than OLEDs.\n\nAs for the TV’s operating system, I find the remote’s “motion as a mouse pointer” a little annoying sometimes, but hardly worth docking stars. Very usable system. The TV handles streaming 4K content from YouTube, Disney, Plex, and other services without issue. The perk of a major brand is knowing popular apps will work without a problem. This remains the case with this set.\n\nLastly, I must discuss my delivery experience. A special freight delivery service is needed for a delivery item of this size. NSD handled fulfillment. My experience was abysmal.\n\nDelivery must be scheduled. A signature is required for delivery, and the item will be placed inside your door (allegedly). NSD was a no-call and no-show on the day of delivery, and they did not reach out to reschedule. I attempted to call NSD for rescheduling three times, was hung up on twice by their system while waiting, and the third time resulted in being told that the local office would call to reschedule. After three more days of no contact, I had to contact chat support another three times over three days, asking to be contacted to reschedule. The second chat said NSD would escalate my delivery due to a no-call no-show. The third chat let me know that had not been done but assured me that they would. The sixth time is the charm. Delivery tracking showed the TV in town for an entire week before delivery was “attempted” and another week before the company finally called to deliver (no rescheduling of delivery, just delivery with only a few minutes warning). I live on a military installation, and the delivery team said they were not able to come onto the installation. This can be the result of several things: a lie, laziness, criminal history of one or both delivery members, or drugs/weapons in the delivery vehicle. As the company did not call to reschedule, I was out of town when they called me for delivery. Fortunately, I had a coworker I trusted to accept delivery off-base and hold the TV at his home until I was able to return.\n\nAs the delivery was not fulfilled by Amazon and the product itself is great, I am not deducting from my rating for this experience. However, let this be a horror story of delivery for potential buyers of the 77” version. If you have to buy online because you are rural like me, select NSD as an absolute last resort. A $2,400 purchase can be quite stressful when no one wants to talk to you about its delivery."

          "review": "After lots of online research and in-store viewing I settled on a previous year model 77\" screen OLED, the LGC2-PUA (not for WalMart or Cosco) model. It has more features than I will regularly use and has the best features of the things I want. The newer G2 isn't really a better product if you can get this model.\n\nI settled on this early for picture quality, but hesitated because other reviews noted the interface as difficult or annoying. Then, I discovered some online videos showing hidden menu features to simplify the display and eliminate those same annoyances that others complained about, but apparently missed the tips on. The menu does SOME self-explaining, but you will need to read about the effects if you want to go mess with a DIY calibration for your room. Default isn't too bad, but there are lots of tweaks you can use to get the best in your home.\n\nI have 81 near-flawless hours on the set after gaining operating tips online for tweaking settings. It displays well even in moderately bright day, as long as direct sun isn't hitting the screen, Evening viewing is quite stunning allowing a change of settings for more depth and color. The screen can be very reflective of lamps and other light sources, but we have overhead lighting so don't have an issue there. Off-axis viewing is decent especially in the vertical as we can watch from the upstairs internal balcony. The unit has a self-cleaning feature at shutdown that refreshes pixels every few hours so that burn-in isn't likely.\n\nSet-up was quick and we followed basic LG advice for unpacking. The stand went on easily but does require two people; one to to position & hold the screen until the through-screws can anchor the pedestal to the set. A/V connectors are placed on the side and easily accessible. Premium-capacity HDMI WILL BE a necessary expense to preserve best quality, but there are many reasonably-priced options.\n\nWe route sound to wired, external speakers with a Denon AVR but the TV sound is not too bad with the AI tweaks built-in, and would work OK in a small room setting.\n\nIt WAS more than I intended to spend (after the existing 2014 65\" plasma died) but has been well-worth the money in quality and performance."

          "rating": "4.0",
          "review": "This really is the best picture quality in the biz. Anything better is only by a small margin in very technical ways that very few users will notice, or need very specific types of scenes in order to display their upper hand. I have a few Samsung QLED displays of varying quality and this blows them away (although Neo QLEDs are closer in match, still not that close). I was sick of inconsistent blacks, backlighting blooming, and other typical LED issues and this TV does not have any of those issues. But I left a little wanting on the software. Here's the breakdown.\n\nPicture Quality 5/5:\nIt's simply the best. Viewing angles are great, contrast is great, HDR and Dolby Vision content is looks spectacular, backlighting is perfect. I had issues with all of these items on my Samsung QLEDs - the blacks and backlighting just completely drove me nuts with those, especially in dark scenes. Practically no viewing angle on a QLED, this you can look at it from 178 degrees with no color degradation. New OLEDs are pretty bright - I live near Phoenix AZ so it's bright everyday, and this is in a North facing living room with big windows. I leave my blinds open all day in there and there are no issues with brightness. So don't listen to people who say it's not bright enough, unless maybe you plan on using this outside in the sun. I will say that the front is more of a reflective glossy surface, so keep in mind lights behind you that may reflect on the tv. I also thought I damaged the panel mounting it to the wall because there were a lot of vertical lines when I turned it on, especially on the left, but after running the Pixel Cleaning cycle on the OLED Panel Care menu the lines completely went away so that's kinda cool.\n\nSoftware 4/5:\nI do like the software on Samsung better. This isn't BAD per-say... it just isn't great. Menus are as clean and easy as the Samsung home screen, or the mini menu that pops over the current content (I don't think LG even has that, just goes to the main home screen). I have a Samsung frame, and that gallery software blows the LG gallery software out of the water. Also not sure you can really compare because a true gallery option isn't really an option due to OLED burn in - you really don't want it displaying one image all day. Alexa kinda doesn't work as well as my Samsung as well. However, I do like that it shows as always on so that I can beam some Airplay content from my phone while the tv is off and it just turns on and goes to my selection.\n\nRemote 4/5:\nEh it's fine. I like the pointer feature, it's better than a wii remote, but if you accidentally scroll the center button instead of click when not using the pointer it switches to pointer and that's annoying. It's also huge! Well, by modern standards. Apple TV remotes are small and maybe too sparse on buttons, but I like the new Samsung remotes that are slim and have the solar charger on the back. They are also bluetooth so you don't need an IR line-of-sight to work. There are a ton of unnecessary buttons on the LG remote. They need to sexy it up and simplify the button layout and switch to BT instead of IR and that would get them back into the modern day remote.\n\nSound 3/5:\nIt's fine - all modern tvs are bad cause they are so slim but this is actually ok. I use their S90QY soundbar/subwoofer so not an issue for me (separate review for that). But why would you buy this tv and go for sub-par sound? Go treat yourself to a nice hometheater, you won't regret the addition.\n\nAesthetics 5/5:\nIt's pretty sexy. People who come over always comment on how thin it is. I have it mounted to the wall with a 0.6\" thick wall mount so that's about as close to the wall as you can get. The bezels are smaller than any other display I've seen. The stand it comes with is unnecessarily big and bulky in my opinion but yeah it looks better on the wall anyways. It's definitely a statement piece in the living room.\n\nDolby Atmos/Dolby Vision 5/5:\nWhenever I stream content that supports this format, it shows a little popover in the top right for a few seconds telling me that it's using that format and my soundbar switches to the right audio profile setting over the e-Arc connection, and the content looks and sounds perfect. Feels like I have the best home theater around. You have to try hard to find it's flaws. Best viewing experience I have ever had.\n\nSummary:\nBest in class viewing experience for the money. They could improve the software and remote a bit, but they aren't unusable and just take a bit of adjusting. Definitely need a good Dolby Atmos capable sound system to really maximize the experience. LG may have finally gotten me off Samsung displays, but now Samsung is hot on their heels with new OLED panels coming out. In 2023, I'd say buy LG C2 OLED (C3 only has marginal improvements for a higher price). We'll see who comes out on top in 2024."

          "review": "This TV is the absolute best I have ever owned, no question. It performs very well in dimly lit and brightly lit rooms. The picture is phenomenal, and I absolutely love the myriad of settings to fine-tune everything exactly how I want.\n\nI game pretty extensively, and my experience of this TV with my Playstation 5 has been excellent! It makes for a great gaming experience, can handle everything that the PS5 is capable of, and I simply love the 'game mode' that the TV has, complete with being able to select the type of game I am playing and it automatically adjusts several settings to match the game.\n\nA big plus for me is the screen burn prevention technology that this TV comes with. The ever so slight dimming of static displays on the screen (a HUD in virtually every game I play), and minor, periodic repositioning of those static images to help prevent screen burn are great! You legitimately don't even notice either feature unless you are really paying attention to it, but it does enough that I have yet to have a single issue with screen burn in the last nearly 4 months of heavy gaming. The TV looks just as good right now as it did when it first came out of the box.\n\nMy ONLY knock on this TV, and it is a relatively minor issue, is that is occasionally thinks I'm talking to it to issue a command when I'm simply gaming with friends. Can be a minor distraction when the prompt comes up on the screen, but it's not a major issue. I ensured that I have the setting off that would allow for hands-free Alexa control, instead opting for it to function under the push-and-hold of the Alexa button on the remote, but somehow that doesn't seem to stop the TV from infrequently trying to operate hands-free regardless. Again, not a huge issue, just a minor annoyance. Everything else that this TV offers far outweighs such a minor thing, so my rating remains at 5 stars.\n\nSimply put, if you want a fantastic OLED TV that definitely delivers on what it promises, the C2 is the way to go. I see that the C3 is about to launch, but the 65\" C2 at under $1700 is perfect for me. I don't have any desire to pay $2500 for the 65\" C3 for what is very likely a minor upgrade, if any at all. I'd have to imagine the C3 might have some software and/or UI changes that may somehow improve general quality-of-life, but I find it very unlikely that the screen quality and image quality of the C3 will be any different. Short of being an 8K resolution, there's nothing I can see where it could be improved. (8K is absolutely useless right now anyway; essentially no media content is in 8K).\n\nPerfect TV without draining your savings account! I may end up buying a second one for my bedroom, in all honesty. It's that good."

          "review": "For me, a TV is 50/50 picture/convenience. This is a zero on convenience. (Update 3/19/23 I'll Never buy an LG tv again).\n\nForget the nonsense about \"oleds don't get that bright\". People are just saying stuff that they hear the pros saying because it's a couple hundred nits lower than an LED set. It's plenty bright for HDR highlights and daytime viewing. I have to squint my eyes. And if you're like most people who work a 9-5 and mostly watch tv in the evenings - you'll find it bright enough. Come on people.\n\nLet's start with the UGLY:\n\nCEC: NIGHTMARE\nI have a PS5, XBSX, Shield Pro. Whether these devices are all plugged into tv then ARC-> Yamaha receiver, -OR- everything plugged into a new Denon 760H receiver then eARC-> tv, it's equally faulty. The tv likes to turn on my PS5 whenever I hit the input button (it shows the row of inputs first like it should, but then turns on and switches to PS5, also whenever I hit the back button from the ThinQ menu (I need to remember to hit the HOME button instead) and other odd buttons it fires up the PS5. Last night it did this when I hit the settings button ?!? Cannot get the Shield Pro to turn the tv on when it powers on. Yet, it will turn the tv on when it's connected to my 10 year old Yamaha receiver (eARC to tv).\nThe Universal Control Management is terrible. So much bloated crap on this TV.\n\nAuto-resume?!? Pause while watching netflix. 3 minutes later it starts playing. Watching something on plex- exit to home screen. 5 min later it switches to Plex and resumes movie.\n\nALEXA: HORRIBLE\nThis has to be the WORST Alexa integration EVER. My 3 year old Sony 900h connected on day one and has been FLAWLESS. Same with my $400 TCL roku tv. I say \"Alexa, turn off xxx tv\" and it would work 100% of the time. NOT ON THIS TV. It took me a week to troubleshoot, uninstalling apps, reinstalling (why are there 2 different LG devices on the Alexa app?!?). I'd say it works 10% of the time. Usually it says \"LG tv is not responding, please check it's network and power connection). If I grab the LG remote and hit the Alexa button and tell it to turn off it will work. But I could obviously just hit the power button on the remote.\n\nUPDATE: try calling the Tv \"tv\" instead of \"lg tv\" . ALSO-\" the tv has its own Alexa built in. Our echo dots are all named \"echo\" so this actually works quite well. Try calling \"alexa\" to the tv and issuing command. This has been working lately rather than telling my dot \"echo, pause the tv\". We'll see tomorrow. /update. (This still only works 50% of the time. Usually says \" network error\". 3/19/23)\n\nLEARNING CURVE: STEEP AF\nMake sure to register at AVSFORUM and read up/post your questions. The menu settings are very confusing and oddly placed. Read the manual, do your research. Go onto RTINGS.\n\nREMOTE: LOVE/HATE\nThe pointer wheel is kind of cool and probably quicker most of the time. It's like using a Wii remote but far more accurate and stable. The problem is when you just want to click over and select something (by pressing the wheel in). But my finger slips and instead of pressing the wheel in it turns the wheel which brings up the pointer and takes much longer to do what I need to do. There's also no Play/Pause button, you need to press in the wheel.\n\nI consider myself a person of average intelligence but it's 2023 All remotes should have 3 things MANDATORY:\n1. ALL buttons need to light up when lifted (like the Shield remote).\n2. There ABSOLUTELY NEEDS to be a sliding LOCK BUTTON to prevent accidental button press (and kid mischief).\n3. It needs to have a remote finder. Go into the app, hit a button, the remote makes a sound.\n(4). It would be nice to have a few learning buttons and customizable app buttons, not just Netflix.\n\n\"Gallery\" feature is a missed opportunity. It only appears if you are on an external input after the device has been powered off. Or you can select the gallery app manually. Here's a stellar idea - why not use the gallery as the screensaver instead of the ugly fireworks or clock?\n\nGAMING: SUPERB\nPlaying Horizon Forbidden West on PS5 at 60+ FPS in 4K is absolutely ASSAULTING on the eyes. It looks incredible! TV is responsive in regards to input lag and response time. When the tv is in GAME MODE, hitting the options button on the TV brings up the GAME menu which shows you all the gaming-related options and displays the current FPS on screen. Very nice.\n\nMOVIES: OBJECTIVE\nNo TV is perfect. Side viewing angle is big for me. I can see the color washout sitting 12\" over on the couch while watching my Sony 900h LCD tv. Unacceptable. This TV has an AWESOME VIEWING ANGLE. Go to RTINGS to view and compare. There is no discernable color/luminance washout in any seat in my living room. You need to go off to the extreme right/left to notice it.\n\nMy dvd backups played via PLEX app on TV look incredible, thanks to the rich OLED blacks. 1080p BD rips also look fantastic (compared to my LCD SONY 900h). And of course 4k content looks great. We all know about the \"inky\" blacks of OLED, no need to talk about it. Image quality is the best I've seen.\n\nSTUTTER/(Judder?):\nThis is a big one for me. During panning shots, usually when there is something tall and thin not moving on the screen there is a HORRIBLE STUTTER effect. It's jaggy and looks like the picture can't keep up. It's extremely jarring and takes me right out of the experience. This is due to the extremely fast response time of OLED technology. I find it extremely undesirable and a flaw. Options to mitigate this will introduce the Soap Opera effect, which is worse IMO.\n\nSOUND OUTPUT\nSound on the tv is fine. The usual. Sound output via ARC/eARC will only output the basics: stereo, Atmos, Dolby Digital and (DD+) to your receiver. And there is a difference between this DD and the DD you will find on a DVD/Blu Ray. It's a much more boring, stripped-down version (as with the Atmos I have heard) It's a lower bitrate signal. But it will suffice if you're going for a true 1-remote system. The TV will NOT OUTPUT DTS, DTS-MA, DD True HD via ARC/eARC. ***UPDATE: RECENT NEWS INFORMED THAT LG MIGHT START OFFERING DTS OUTPUT VIA ARC. IT'S UNSURE WHETHER THIS TV WILL RECEIVE THIS UPDATE*** Go onto RTINGS to check this info. Most TV's these days do not support outputting hi res audio signals which is unfortunate. The Nvidia Shield Pro is the recommended set-top box if hi-res audio is important to you.\n\nwebOS: fine\nEveryone seems to hate on the webOS. Look, they ALL have ads. I much prefer the Google Android (SONY tv, Shield) OS. But this one is fine. It offers all the apps I need: Netflix HBO MAX, Hulu, Disney +, and all the other ones, and displays them in a row at the bottom of the screen. You can easily go to what you want without looking or noticing all the other ads and crap on the tv. There is also another \"ThinQ\" app home screen where you can look at more crap you will probably never use. I stay away from all of this and hit my buttons very precisely otherwise one wrong move and I will launch the PS5 or some other device via CEC.\n\nHINT: If your PS5 (maybe other devices too) does turn on, hit the (...) button on the LG remote to bring up a menu where you can put the PS5 back into sleep mode.\n\nEYES\nIt took about 6 weeks for my eyes to adjust to this tv. Not sure of it was the detail, the brightness (it's plenty bright for me) or the blue light - whatever - my eyes got strained. It felt like a dull pressure behind my eyeballs. I'm 43 and perhaps I have some eye issues, so this is objective. I'm sort of used to it now, however I do start to feel eye strain in excess of 2/3 hours. Sooner if gaming.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: WOULD I BUY THIS TV AGAIN?\nI don't think so, especially now with other brands (SONY) offering OLED. I just don't think I should have so much to complain about with a $2500 tv. I would expect it with HiSense, TCL, Westinghouse basement bargain garage sale tvs, but not with a top shelf LG OLED.\n\nI would NOT choose OLED if there was another tech that offered similar gaming response time, decent black levels, and NO STUTTER during panning shots. This is like right on the edge of being a deal-breaker for me.\n\n1/30/23 - I will update when/if things change. 3/19/23. I still hate this tv. Love the picture quality but just HATE the way it operates and all the shortcomings. No more LG for me."

          "review": "Yes, I didn't give this a great rating because the engineers made way too many amateurish mistakes in the user interface. To show why is a long review ...\n\nThis TV lacks ATSC 3.0. In the end, I didn't care much because when I downloaded the manual of a very popular competitor's TV that \"had\" ATSC 3.0, the manual stated it wouldn't decode the high def content! Wow--not very useful. So, I wondered how many other TVs had the same limitation that \"claimed\" ATSC 3.0 which is why I removed that as a requirement.\n\nI personally feel that we are approaching the point of diminishing returns on how good TV displays look. Case in point, I looked at the TVs at Walmart & Target, which cost 1/3 this one and they don't look bad. Yes, you can see some color shifting at extreme angles, but still, not bad. As for more expensive TVs, I looked at the various reviews out there and my take is that you can measure differences in display quality amongst the ones costing more or less the same, but unless the TVs are sitting side by side, I think the display difference is barely perceptible, if at all (some reviews actually mention this). In the end, I decided to focus on the user interface of the TVs, not rely on reviewer's measurements.\n\nBefore I go into the remote and user interaction I want to discuss the poor upconversion when watching 480i TV. The jaggies are readily apparent and so bad, small text is difficult to read. It's like all they did was double the pixels and did little interpolation. I attempted to take some pictures. One is from live TV and the other is the same program recorded (and interpolated) by my HTPC. My HTPC with 10 year old software and processor uses a very basic linear interpolation algorithm and it outperforms this TV when displaying this content.\n\nOne thing I noticed when looking at the various TVs was some remotes didn't have numbers. Wow. I'm a TV watcher. I couldn't imagine scrolling through channels trying to get to the one I want.\n\nThe remote is an RF one, but the TV does support an IR one (you lose the \"mouse like cursor\" and I think the \"mouse wheel\" though). The first thing you notice is the buttons are kind of small and close together. I have small hands, so I didn't care.\n\nThe layout is bad. They didn't even try. No excuse--they've been making remotes for how many decades?? The volume up/down paddle is on the left. Below it is the home button, NOT the mute button (the mute button is in the center, where the home button should be). The \"go back to previous channel\" button is on the left, not on the right where the channel up/down paddle is. What this means is you'll be looking at your remote a lot.\n\nThen you notice the various input selection \"types\": up/down \"paddles\" for volume and channels; a ring that can be pressed up/down and maybe left/right; a mouse-like wheel; and don't forget the \"mouse cursor\". Why all of them? It's like rather than do a quality exercise by having various people interact with it and give feedback so they could select one or two, they just used all of them. One problem is all the real estate wasted by this. The other issue is, and this is really weird: the different buttons only work in certain situations. For example, when you start typing a channel number, a list pops up with the channels it could be. You can use the ring to move the selection up/down, but NOT the mouse wheel--apparently, it's function is (apparently only) to scroll to the next channel you are currently watching--it won't work to move the selection up/down. And you can't use the mouse cursor either. It's darn right amateurish, by engineering standards. Think about using a PC/Mac app and in one spot, you had to use the up/down arrows; in another spot you use the mouse, in yet another, you used the mouse wheel. It's maddening and makes it hard to use.\n\nThe \"go back\" ONLY deals with TV channels. It should go back to what was previously displayed on the TV. For example, if you were watching HDMI input 3 and jumped to TV channel 3.2, pressing the \"go back\" button should take you back to HDMI input 3. This is nice because it's a hack to act as a screensaver if you pause the video on an HDMI input. This display suffers from image retention, so if you get up to make popcorn, for example, you don't want a still image. Since there's no \"screen saver\" button (hint), this hack works nicely to quickly jump back and forth. My old Panasonic TV did this and I used it all the time.\n\nThe cursor is nice (and it's fun to use). The mouse wheel works pretty well. I think they found the sweet spot for how hard it is to turn and falsely turning it. However, the wheel is a selection button as well, and a couple of times when scrolling I inadvertently pushed too hard and selected something I didn't want. Also, when scrolling through the up/down submenu for channel selection, I have hit that wheel causing a channel change that I didn't want.\n\nThe remote has a bunch of largish \"quick jump\" buttons on the bottom for jumping to various streaming services. However, they take up valuable real estate. I'd rather they were smaller or replaced by a row of smaller buttons you could program to the stream of choice. There's some small colored buttons (have yet to determine their purpose) and maybe they would suffice.\n\nThe RF remote has a voice input. I was looking forward to trying it out, but it only works if the TV is connected to the internet.\n\nWhen you power up an external device connected to HDMI, a popup appears asking if you want to go to that HDMI input. Nice, BUT, if you try to use the mouse wheel, it unselects the default \"Yes\", but doesn't select the other option (\"No\"). You have to use the ring for that.\n\nOne last note about the RF remote. There are a lot of clones for sale here and elsewhere. Beware. Some hint they are RF remotes when they aren't. And every non LG RF one I looked at appeared to be lacking a sticker on the back with the FCC ID. To be legal for sale/use in the U.S., each device emitting RF must have an FCC ID (that you can lookup) to verify it passed FCC tests. This is to ensure the safety of you and your neighbors. Imagine someone attached to some medical equipment that is interfered with by an illegal RF remote.\n\nUPDATE: I've had this awhile now. I've noticed glitches every now and then. Sometimes it's slow reacting to user input. It lost track of time (was like 10 hours off). I had to uncheck \"auto\" and set it manually to correct it. Time will tell if it will keep track of daylight savings time for me. Lastly, I was looking at the OTA content guide (\"what's on each channel\"--part of ATSC meta data). I moved the remote too quick which causes the cursor to display and then all the channel data blanked out. I had to exit out and come back in to get it to display the content.\n\nTo be fair--there have been two or three updates now for this TV (yikes--why so many?!). Maybe they fixed some of the glitches I'm seeing. However, I'm not a big fan of updating--my experience says you risk breaking something.\n\nAnd the weird layout of the remote is still driving me nuts. I wish a 3rd party would make a remote for these TVs."

          "rating": "3.0",
          "review": "This TV provides excellent picture quality and that was the main reason I purchased it. However, The remote is awful for a couple reasons. Mainly, you can't see any of the buttons in a dark room because the remote does not light up and the design of the buttons makes them very hard to see in dim lighting. The second reason the remote is terrible is the toggle wheel in the center of the main buttons. Unless you want to use the remote like a Wii controller, this wheel toggle is incredibly annoying because it causes the remote to switch to a motion sensor cursor that is difficult to use.\n\nThe other downfall of this TV is the interface itself. There are so many things wrong with the user experience. All of the tiles for your main apps like Netflix and Max are super tiny and it is not clear if you have one selected.\n\nIf you are in an app such as Max and want to leave, it asks you an extra question \"Are you sure you want to exit\" adding a step. It's not the end of the world, but it is annoying. To make matters worse, when you do hit \"Exit\" it boots you out of the tv completely rather than taking you back to the home screen where all the other apps are. These are basic functions that are very poorly designed and make using this TV clunky and irritating.\n\nAll this to say I would give the TV 5 stars for picture and 2 stars for usability. I get excited each time it says there is a system update only to be let down that literally nothing changed. There are better TVs with the same quality picture so save yourself the frustration and keep looking."

After alot of thinking, I chose the C2 over the SONY x95K (mini led) when I watched comparison videos, and, looked for myself at best buy (they let me adjst settings, etc). I also looked at the Sony A80, which uses the EXACT same panel as the C2 (made by LG) - and I must say, the C2 impressed me the most.\n\nPicture is breathtaking, brightness is blinding during Star Trek shows where there is a brighly lit space battle, and also other films where the sun is out, etc. I had not weird tint, dead pixels, etc - no clue if I got the WBE panel, and I don't care - it's the best TV I've owned so far. It took alot for me to chose the C2, I am titally a SONY fanboy, but, when my 2019 - 950G (FALD) Sony died and was not reparable (panel went out) I got a refund from my square trade warranty and I was dissapointed over my SONY only lasting short of 3 years.

I played around with the TV settings to remedy problem, But in the end the only sure fire way to fix the problem was to unplug the TV for a cold start. Cold starting sound bar did have no discernable affect on connectivity. Seems to be a TV issue (SW/HW?) and not a sound bar issue.

PS5 and Xbox SX look amazing (checks all boxes on XSX display settings) and haven't shown any screen tear.\n\nMy main complaint with this TV is really just the Home Screen and overall menu. Home Screen features a huge sponsored ad that takes up half the screen. If it were just the bottom half and kept the video playing in the background like the old Samsung Tizen OS menu, that'd be amazing. I do like that I can swiftly swap between Energy Saving modes to adjust brightness according to my surroundings.\n\nA few LG Channels require you to download the PlutoTV app to watch the channel, but it didn't tell me to do so until it made me watch commercials first for some reason.\n\nOverall happy with what I have and will update later down the line if anything pops up."

          "review": "Should preface when I turned it on there was some texturing in the middle when all solid colors. This is somewhat normal. I did a pixel cleaning and it was 100% gone and haven’t noticed anything else. If this happens it’s alright it’s normal AND the panel does this cleaning automatically after being turned off. So you will notice if your screen has been on for a couple hours turning it off will not make the same click. It will then click off idk 20 minutes later with a little light at the bottom. Just wanted to preface with that knowledge as I feel I’m a bit more technologically inclined and was still a bit spooked by the texture. Now onto the actual tv. The panel looks perfect. HDR is really bright, colors pop, and blacks are perfect. Features include auto low latency mode meaning a pc or console connection instantly turns it to lowest latency. The input lag on this tv is lower than any panel I’ve ever used even a TN 144hz panel. Airplay 2 support means you can “cast” 1080p 60 hdr video with no loss of quality. I have to be honest even 720p video looks freaking awesome on this due to the super sampling. I personally also enjoy the interpolation this tv provides. Little to actually no artifacts with just fluid motion. Everything has worked correctly and consistently with this TV. This tv is perfect for gaming imo. Such low latency and VRR, GSync, and freesync all work correctly. No flickering, works all way down to 20hz, and even works correctly with my nividia gpu. Additionally this tv even supports Bluetooth if you want to not have the speakers going. The speakers though sound much better than I was expecting I have no desire to get any external equipment. They are very full and no mud even with super low or high frequencies. I’m not saying it’s better than a sound bar I’m just saying it’s definitely the best TV speakers I’ve ever heard. This review is a bit all round but honestly this tv is worth far more than the 1.3k I paid for the 55inch. When it came out it was high high 2k range. It has that level of quality and personally I wouldn’t even look at the c3 or g3 unless these are sold out. In short out of 100 I’d give it 100/100 this isn’t a rounding 5/5 it’s truly perfect and I have no complaints. Get it trust me you won’t be disappointed in the product."

          "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023",
          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "NOTE: LG recently released a firmware update to the LG C2 that substantially reduces the ABL auto-dimming! This makes it much more competitive to the PG4*UQ and other OLEDs without opening the service menu to disable those features.\n\nI hear a lot of issues people have with using a TV as a monitor, especially this one, but I haven't had any such issues. After setting it up properly, the only problem is the RWBG subpixel layout and having to turn it on along with my computer. But as someone that grew up with CRT monitors, having to press an extra button in addition to the power button is not even the slightest bit inconvenient. The thing that really kills this as a monitor is the subpixel layout.\nRWBG adds noticeable fringing and bleed on text on OSes calibrated for RGB subpixels. Turning subpixel rendering compensation off makes it tolerable, but it's still much harder to read than on a normal monitor, and some games use it regardless of OS settings with no obvious way to adjust it. For visual content like movies and games it isn't noticeable at all, however.\nAs long as you aren't planning to read a whole bunch, or if you sit further back and make your text bigger so the subpixels don't mess with the text as much, there isn't a single issue with using this as a computer monitor.\n\nI originally purchased the PG42UQ and PG48UQ instead, and got 2 dead 42's and one 48 that only survived for a few weeks before it spontaneously died. I'd like to compare some points on the C2 vs PG4*UQ:\n- The box on the C2 is thicker, the Styrofoam completely protects the screen unlike on the PG4*UQ where there are tons of gaps, the Styrofoam on the corners is also much thicker preventing drops from affecting the corners like what happened to BOTH of my PG42UQs, and the accessories and feet are placed in sane location unlike the strange Styrofoam origami that was both the PG42UQ and PG48UQ.\n- On both, the panel quality is fantastic. But on the C2, you can really tweak the settings until everything is perfect, especially if you have the service remote or other way to get into the service menu. This TV in particular can easily be color calibrated to make it shine in whatever environment you put it in with 22 point white balance adjustment, gamma curves, and multiple black/white level boosts and compensations.\n- The glossy screen is a boon as it leaves the blacks completely dark, vs. a matte screen like on the PG4*UQ where there is significant light bleed and blooming.\n- The C2's panel is much thicker and doesn't feel fragile compared to the dangerously paper-thin, basically unprotected edges on the PG4*UQ\n- The power button housing on the bottom doesn't bend easily and feel like it's going to snap off like on the PG4*UQ. It's also much thinner and less obnoxious to look at. Man, I hate \"gamer\" stuff.\n- In general, the design on the C2 is much more sleek, simple, and modern, allowing it to fit into the room better than the eye-catching \"gamer\" aesthetic on the PG4*UQ.\n- Due to the thicker panel backplate and rear cover design, the C2 is easier to lift safely without feeling like you're going to damage it.\n- All the cable managing on the C2 is in one spot on one side only, instead of top, right, and bottom.\n- With the right settings in Game Optimizer mode, the C2 can reach the same point-for-point performance metrics as the PG4*UQ, with only the peak brightness not being as good (but that doesn't matter as it dips substantially for both the second a scene starts getting bright, after which the difference is negligible).\n- The subpixel layout on the PG4*UQ is better for reading text. This is the only praise I have for it over the C2.\n- The refresh rate can be overclocked on the PG4*UQ to a staggering 138Hz! Wow, how impressive. Unfortunately, the difference visually between 120Hz and 138Hz is basically nonexistent, as someone that has compared the C2 at 120Hz and PG48UQ at 138Hz. The response time is still fantastic on both units regardless of mode.\n\nOverall, highly recommend this as both a TV and a monitor. I don't use the smart features and leave it disconnected from the network, and unlike with other smart TV platforms, the C2 doesn't annoy you and simply lets you use it without the smart feature bloat impeding you. And if I want to consume content and use the motion smoothing etc. features, they're there at a press of the button. I don't think all the massive number of problems with the ASUS units make the overclocking or other small extra features worth it; and at the same time, the C2 offers some nice features of its own that the PG4*UQ doesn't have. I would highly recommend it as a multimon replacement as I am, if you're willing to live with the subpixel layout and having to turn the TV on and off separately to the connected PC; do note there is a Windows-only, community-maintained companion app, which I can't use as I don't use Windows."

          "review": "I recently purchased a TV from this seller on Amazon, and I must say that the experience has been nothing short of outstanding. From the moment I placed the order to the prompt delivery, everything went incredibly smoothly.\n\nFirst and foremost, the TV itself is a gem. The picture quality is absolutely breathtaking, with vibrant colors and crisp details that bring every scene to life. The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience. I find myself completely immersed in my favorite movies and TV shows, thanks to this remarkable television.\n\nWhat truly sets this seller apart, though, is their exceptional customer service. Throughout the entire process, they were attentive, responsive, and went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction. They promptly answered all my pre-purchase questions, providing detailed information and expert advice to help me make an informed decision. Their dedication to customer satisfaction was evident from start to finish.\n\nFurthermore, the packaging was done with utmost care and attention to detail. The TV arrived in perfect condition, securely protected against any potential damage during transit. It was evident that the seller takes great pride in their products and values the customer's experience.\n\nI also appreciated the easy setup process. The instructions provided were clear and concise, allowing me to have the TV up and running in no time. It's always a pleasure when a product lives up to its promises, and this TV certainly exceeded my expectations.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase from this seller on Amazon. They have proven themselves to be reliable, trustworthy, and committed to delivering an exceptional customer experience. If you're in the market for a new TV, I highly recommend considering their offerings. I will undoubtedly turn to them for any future electronic needs. Kudos to the seller for their outstanding product and impeccable service!"

          "review": "Version: 77 inch\nSeller: Amazon\nDelivery by: NSD (more about this at the bottom)\nPhoto 1: 68\" width. Will need large tv stand to look \"right\".\nPhoto 2: Mid-day reflection handling.\nPhoto 3: Inputs are on the left side of the set. Thin screen, but a wider portion holds the internals.\n\nFirst, the product.\n\nThe picture is fantastic. Viewing high bit-rate content such as Blu-rays is amazing. Ultra HD (2160p) HDR content is flawless and Full HD (1080p) SDR content is handled well. I like the upscaling of my Nvidia Shield for 1080p-> 4K upscaling over the TV’s, but most individuals will find no issues. The ability to turn off pixels for true black allows for an amazing contrast of color and blacks.\n\nThis TV supports high frame rate video game consoles with up to 120 FPS and offers a variable refresh rate (VRR) for gaming that isn’t locked at a steady 120/60/30 FPS. VRR ensures that games that support it will appear smoother and free of the screen tearing that is normally associated with frame rates that don’t match the TV. For PS5 owners, this means games that support a 40 FPS mode can be fully enjoyed on this TV. For PC owners, your 60-120 FPS experience will be similar to a good monitor, plus the amazing features of a top-tier TV. Also, input latency while in game mode is untouchable by non-OLED displays.\n\nThe TV speakers sound fine for daytime TV programming, but I utilize the TV’s eARC feature to send audio to my sound system. This feature works fine and is only a menu toggle away. Unfortunately, I can’t speak on the audio performance beyond this.\n\nThe set handles reflections well, but that doesn’t mean they disappear. This brings me to my one issue with this set, which is an issue shared with most OLEDs. OLED does not get extremely bright. If you intend to use this set in a living room with many windows, I suggest black-out curtains for the best viewing. If you cannot control the light in your room, I recommend considering a high-end LED TV instead, as they can get much brighter than OLEDs.\n\nAs for the TV’s operating system, I find the remote’s “motion as a mouse pointer” a little annoying sometimes, but hardly worth docking stars. Very usable system. The TV handles streaming 4K content from YouTube, Disney, Plex, and other services without issue. The perk of a major brand is knowing popular apps will work without a problem. This remains the case with this set.\n\nLastly, I must discuss my delivery experience. A special freight delivery service is needed for a delivery item of this size. NSD handled fulfillment. My experience was abysmal.\n\nDelivery must be scheduled. A signature is required for delivery, and the item will be placed inside your door (allegedly). NSD was a no-call and no-show on the day of delivery, and they did not reach out to reschedule. I attempted to call NSD for rescheduling three times, was hung up on twice by their system while waiting, and the third time resulted in being told that the local office would call to reschedule. After three more days of no contact, I had to contact chat support another three times over three days, asking to be contacted to reschedule. The second chat said NSD would escalate my delivery due to a no-call no-show. The third chat let me know that had not been done but assured me that they would. The sixth time is the charm. Delivery tracking showed the TV in town for an entire week before delivery was “attempted” and another week before the company finally called to deliver (no rescheduling of delivery, just delivery with only a few minutes warning). I live on a military installation, and the delivery team said they were not able to come onto the installation. This can be the result of several things: a lie, laziness, criminal history of one or both delivery members, or drugs/weapons in the delivery vehicle. As the company did not call to reschedule, I was out of town when they called me for delivery. Fortunately, I had a coworker I trusted to accept delivery off-base and hold the TV at his home until I was able to return.\n\nAs the delivery was not fulfilled by Amazon and the product itself is great, I am not deducting from my rating for this experience. However, let this be a horror story of delivery for potential buyers of the 77” version. If you have to buy online because you are rural like me, select NSD as an absolute last resort. A $2,400 purchase can be quite stressful when no one wants to talk to you about its delivery."

          "review": "After lots of online research and in-store viewing I settled on a previous year model 77\" screen OLED, the LGC2-PUA (not for WalMart or Cosco) model. It has more features than I will regularly use and has the best features of the things I want. The newer G2 isn't really a better product if you can get this model.\n\nI settled on this early for picture quality, but hesitated because other reviews noted the interface as difficult or annoying. Then, I discovered some online videos showing hidden menu features to simplify the display and eliminate those same annoyances that others complained about, but apparently missed the tips on. The menu does SOME self-explaining, but you will need to read about the effects if you want to go mess with a DIY calibration for your room. Default isn't too bad, but there are lots of tweaks you can use to get the best in your home.\n\nI have 81 near-flawless hours on the set after gaining operating tips online for tweaking settings. It displays well even in moderately bright day, as long as direct sun isn't hitting the screen, Evening viewing is quite stunning allowing a change of settings for more depth and color. The screen can be very reflective of lamps and other light sources, but we have overhead lighting so don't have an issue there. Off-axis viewing is decent especially in the vertical as we can watch from the upstairs internal balcony. The unit has a self-cleaning feature at shutdown that refreshes pixels every few hours so that burn-in isn't likely.\n\nSet-up was quick and we followed basic LG advice for unpacking. The stand went on easily but does require two people; one to to position & hold the screen until the through-screws can anchor the pedestal to the set. A/V connectors are placed on the side and easily accessible. Premium-capacity HDMI WILL BE a necessary expense to preserve best quality, but there are many reasonably-priced options.\n\nWe route sound to wired, external speakers with a Denon AVR but the TV sound is not too bad with the AI tweaks built-in, and would work OK in a small room setting.\n\nIt WAS more than I intended to spend (after the existing 2014 65\" plasma died) but has been well-worth the money in quality and performance."

          "rating": "4.0",
          "review": "This really is the best picture quality in the biz. Anything better is only by a small margin in very technical ways that very few users will notice, or need very specific types of scenes in order to display their upper hand. I have a few Samsung QLED displays of varying quality and this blows them away (although Neo QLEDs are closer in match, still not that close). I was sick of inconsistent blacks, backlighting blooming, and other typical LED issues and this TV does not have any of those issues. But I left a little wanting on the software. Here's the breakdown.\n\nPicture Quality 5/5:\nIt's simply the best. Viewing angles are great, contrast is great, HDR and Dolby Vision content is looks spectacular, backlighting is perfect. I had issues with all of these items on my Samsung QLEDs - the blacks and backlighting just completely drove me nuts with those, especially in dark scenes. Practically no viewing angle on a QLED, this you can look at it from 178 degrees with no color degradation. New OLEDs are pretty bright - I live near Phoenix AZ so it's bright everyday, and this is in a North facing living room with big windows. I leave my blinds open all day in there and there are no issues with brightness. So don't listen to people who say it's not bright enough, unless maybe you plan on using this outside in the sun. I will say that the front is more of a reflective glossy surface, so keep in mind lights behind you that may reflect on the tv. I also thought I damaged the panel mounting it to the wall because there were a lot of vertical lines when I turned it on, especially on the left, but after running the Pixel Cleaning cycle on the OLED Panel Care menu the lines completely went away so that's kinda cool.\n\nSoftware 4/5:\nI do like the software on Samsung better. This isn't BAD per-say... it just isn't great. Menus are as clean and easy as the Samsung home screen, or the mini menu that pops over the current content (I don't think LG even has that, just goes to the main home screen). I have a Samsung frame, and that gallery software blows the LG gallery software out of the water. Also not sure you can really compare because a true gallery option isn't really an option due to OLED burn in - you really don't want it displaying one image all day. Alexa kinda doesn't work as well as my Samsung as well. However, I do like that it shows as always on so that I can beam some Airplay content from my phone while the tv is off and it just turns on and goes to my selection.\n\nRemote 4/5:\nEh it's fine. I like the pointer feature, it's better than a wii remote, but if you accidentally scroll the center button instead of click when not using the pointer it switches to pointer and that's annoying. It's also huge! Well, by modern standards. Apple TV remotes are small and maybe too sparse on buttons, but I like the new Samsung remotes that are slim and have the solar charger on the back. They are also bluetooth so you don't need an IR line-of-sight to work. There are a ton of unnecessary buttons on the LG remote. They need to sexy it up and simplify the button layout and switch to BT instead of IR and that would get them back into the modern day remote.\n\nSound 3/5:\nIt's fine - all modern tvs are bad cause they are so slim but this is actually ok. I use their S90QY soundbar/subwoofer so not an issue for me (separate review for that). But why would you buy this tv and go for sub-par sound? Go treat yourself to a nice hometheater, you won't regret the addition.\n\nAesthetics 5/5:\nIt's pretty sexy. People who come over always comment on how thin it is. I have it mounted to the wall with a 0.6\" thick wall mount so that's about as close to the wall as you can get. The bezels are smaller than any other display I've seen. The stand it comes with is unnecessarily big and bulky in my opinion but yeah it looks better on the wall anyways. It's definitely a statement piece in the living room.\n\nDolby Atmos/Dolby Vision 5/5:\nWhenever I stream content that supports this format, it shows a little popover in the top right for a few seconds telling me that it's using that format and my soundbar switches to the right audio profile setting over the e-Arc connection, and the content looks and sounds perfect. Feels like I have the best home theater around. You have to try hard to find it's flaws. Best viewing experience I have ever had.\n\nSummary:\nBest in class viewing experience for the money. They could improve the software and remote a bit, but they aren't unusable and just take a bit of adjusting. Definitely need a good Dolby Atmos capable sound system to really maximize the experience. LG may have finally gotten me off Samsung displays, but now Samsung is hot on their heels with new OLED panels coming out. In 2023, I'd say buy LG C2 OLED (C3 only has marginal improvements for a higher price). We'll see who comes out on top in 2024."

          "review": "This TV is the absolute best I have ever owned, no question. It performs very well in dimly lit and brightly lit rooms. The picture is phenomenal, and I absolutely love the myriad of settings to fine-tune everything exactly how I want.\n\nI game pretty extensively, and my experience of this TV with my Playstation 5 has been excellent! It makes for a great gaming experience, can handle everything that the PS5 is capable of, and I simply love the 'game mode' that the TV has, complete with being able to select the type of game I am playing and it automatically adjusts several settings to match the game.\n\nA big plus for me is the screen burn prevention technology that this TV comes with. The ever so slight dimming of static displays on the screen (a HUD in virtually every game I play), and minor, periodic repositioning of those static images to help prevent screen burn are great! You legitimately don't even notice either feature unless you are really paying attention to it, but it does enough that I have yet to have a single issue with screen burn in the last nearly 4 months of heavy gaming. The TV looks just as good right now as it did when it first came out of the box.\n\nMy ONLY knock on this TV, and it is a relatively minor issue, is that is occasionally thinks I'm talking to it to issue a command when I'm simply gaming with friends. Can be a minor distraction when the prompt comes up on the screen, but it's not a major issue. I ensured that I have the setting off that would allow for hands-free Alexa control, instead opting for it to function under the push-and-hold of the Alexa button on the remote, but somehow that doesn't seem to stop the TV from infrequently trying to operate hands-free regardless. Again, not a huge issue, just a minor annoyance. Everything else that this TV offers far outweighs such a minor thing, so my rating remains at 5 stars.\n\nSimply put, if you want a fantastic OLED TV that definitely delivers on what it promises, the C2 is the way to go. I see that the C3 is about to launch, but the 65\" C2 at under $1700 is perfect for me. I don't have any desire to pay $2500 for the 65\" C3 for what is very likely a minor upgrade, if any at all. I'd have to imagine the C3 might have some software and/or UI changes that may somehow improve general quality-of-life, but I find it very unlikely that the screen quality and image quality of the C3 will be any different. Short of being an 8K resolution, there's nothing I can see where it could be improved. (8K is absolutely useless right now anyway; essentially no media content is in 8K).\n\nPerfect TV without draining your savings account! I may end up buying a second one for my bedroom, in all honesty. It's that good."

          "review": "For me, a TV is 50/50 picture/convenience. This is a zero on convenience. (Update 3/19/23 I'll Never buy an LG tv again).\n\nForget the nonsense about \"oleds don't get that bright\". People are just saying stuff that they hear the pros saying because it's a couple hundred nits lower than an LED set. It's plenty bright for HDR highlights and daytime viewing. I have to squint my eyes. And if you're like most people who work a 9-5 and mostly watch tv in the evenings - you'll find it bright enough. Come on people.\n\nLet's start with the UGLY:\n\nCEC: NIGHTMARE\nI have a PS5, XBSX, Shield Pro. Whether these devices are all plugged into tv then ARC-> Yamaha receiver, -OR- everything plugged into a new Denon 760H receiver then eARC-> tv, it's equally faulty. The tv likes to turn on my PS5 whenever I hit the input button (it shows the row of inputs first like it should, but then turns on and switches to PS5, also whenever I hit the back button from the ThinQ menu (I need to remember to hit the HOME button instead) and other odd buttons it fires up the PS5. Last night it did this when I hit the settings button ?!? Cannot get the Shield Pro to turn the tv on when it powers on. Yet, it will turn the tv on when it's connected to my 10 year old Yamaha receiver (eARC to tv).\nThe Universal Control Management is terrible. So much bloated crap on this TV.\n\nAuto-resume?!? Pause while watching netflix. 3 minutes later it starts playing. Watching something on plex- exit to home screen. 5 min later it switches to Plex and resumes movie.\n\nALEXA: HORRIBLE\nThis has to be the WORST Alexa integration EVER. My 3 year old Sony 900h connected on day one and has been FLAWLESS. Same with my $400 TCL roku tv. I say \"Alexa, turn off xxx tv\" and it would work 100% of the time. NOT ON THIS TV. It took me a week to troubleshoot, uninstalling apps, reinstalling (why are there 2 different LG devices on the Alexa app?!?). I'd say it works 10% of the time. Usually it says \"LG tv is not responding, please check it's network and power connection). If I grab the LG remote and hit the Alexa button and tell it to turn off it will work. But I could obviously just hit the power button on the remote.\n\nUPDATE: try calling the Tv \"tv\" instead of \"lg tv\" . ALSO-\" the tv has its own Alexa built in. Our echo dots are all named \"echo\" so this actually works quite well. Try calling \"alexa\" to the tv and issuing command. This has been working lately rather than telling my dot \"echo, pause the tv\". We'll see tomorrow. /update. (This still only works 50% of the time. Usually says \" network error\". 3/19/23)\n\nLEARNING CURVE: STEEP AF\nMake sure to register at AVSFORUM and read up/post your questions. The menu settings are very confusing and oddly placed. Read the manual, do your research. Go onto RTINGS.\n\nREMOTE: LOVE/HATE\nThe pointer wheel is kind of cool and probably quicker most of the time. It's like using a Wii remote but far more accurate and stable. The problem is when you just want to click over and select something (by pressing the wheel in). But my finger slips and instead of pressing the wheel in it turns the wheel which brings up the pointer and takes much longer to do what I need to do. There's also no Play/Pause button, you need to press in the wheel.\n\nI consider myself a person of average intelligence but it's 2023 All remotes should have 3 things MANDATORY:\n1. ALL buttons need to light up when lifted (like the Shield remote).\n2. There ABSOLUTELY NEEDS to be a sliding LOCK BUTTON to prevent accidental button press (and kid mischief).\n3. It needs to have a remote finder. Go into the app, hit a button, the remote makes a sound.\n(4). It would be nice to have a few learning buttons and customizable app buttons, not just Netflix.\n\n\"Gallery\" feature is a missed opportunity. It only appears if you are on an external input after the device has been powered off. Or you can select the gallery app manually. Here's a stellar idea - why not use the gallery as the screensaver instead of the ugly fireworks or clock?\n\nGAMING: SUPERB\nPlaying Horizon Forbidden West on PS5 at 60+ FPS in 4K is absolutely ASSAULTING on the eyes. It looks incredible! TV is responsive in regards to input lag and response time. When the tv is in GAME MODE, hitting the options button on the TV brings up the GAME menu which shows you all the gaming-related options and displays the current FPS on screen. Very nice.\n\nMOVIES: OBJECTIVE\nNo TV is perfect. Side viewing angle is big for me. I can see the color washout sitting 12\" over on the couch while watching my Sony 900h LCD tv. Unacceptable. This TV has an AWESOME VIEWING ANGLE. Go to RTINGS to view and compare. There is no discernable color/luminance washout in any seat in my living room. You need to go off to the extreme right/left to notice it.\n\nMy dvd backups played via PLEX app on TV look incredible, thanks to the rich OLED blacks. 1080p BD rips also look fantastic (compared to my LCD SONY 900h). And of course 4k content looks great. We all know about the \"inky\" blacks of OLED, no need to talk about it. Image quality is the best I've seen.\n\nSTUTTER/(Judder?):\nThis is a big one for me. During panning shots, usually when there is something tall and thin not moving on the screen there is a HORRIBLE STUTTER effect. It's jaggy and looks like the picture can't keep up. It's extremely jarring and takes me right out of the experience. This is due to the extremely fast response time of OLED technology. I find it extremely undesirable and a flaw. Options to mitigate this will introduce the Soap Opera effect, which is worse IMO.\n\nSOUND OUTPUT\nSound on the tv is fine. The usual. Sound output via ARC/eARC will only output the basics: stereo, Atmos, Dolby Digital and (DD+) to your receiver. And there is a difference between this DD and the DD you will find on a DVD/Blu Ray. It's a much more boring, stripped-down version (as with the Atmos I have heard) It's a lower bitrate signal. But it will suffice if you're going for a true 1-remote system. The TV will NOT OUTPUT DTS, DTS-MA, DD True HD via ARC/eARC. ***UPDATE: RECENT NEWS INFORMED THAT LG MIGHT START OFFERING DTS OUTPUT VIA ARC. IT'S UNSURE WHETHER THIS TV WILL RECEIVE THIS UPDATE*** Go onto RTINGS to check this info. Most TV's these days do not support outputting hi res audio signals which is unfortunate. The Nvidia Shield Pro is the recommended set-top box if hi-res audio is important to you.\n\nwebOS: fine\nEveryone seems to hate on the webOS. Look, they ALL have ads. I much prefer the Google Android (SONY tv, Shield) OS. But this one is fine. It offers all the apps I need: Netflix HBO MAX, Hulu, Disney +, and all the other ones, and displays them in a row at the bottom of the screen. You can easily go to what you want without looking or noticing all the other ads and crap on the tv. There is also another \"ThinQ\" app home screen where you can look at more crap you will probably never use. I stay away from all of this and hit my buttons very precisely otherwise one wrong move and I will launch the PS5 or some other device via CEC.\n\nHINT: If your PS5 (maybe other devices too) does turn on, hit the (...) button on the LG remote to bring up a menu where you can put the PS5 back into sleep mode.\n\nEYES\nIt took about 6 weeks for my eyes to adjust to this tv. Not sure of it was the detail, the brightness (it's plenty bright for me) or the blue light - whatever - my eyes got strained. It felt like a dull pressure behind my eyeballs. I'm 43 and perhaps I have some eye issues, so this is objective. I'm sort of used to it now, however I do start to feel eye strain in excess of 2/3 hours. Sooner if gaming.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: WOULD I BUY THIS TV AGAIN?\nI don't think so, especially now with other brands (SONY) offering OLED. I just don't think I should have so much to complain about with a $2500 tv. I would expect it with HiSense, TCL, Westinghouse basement bargain garage sale tvs, but not with a top shelf LG OLED.\n\nI would NOT choose OLED if there was another tech that offered similar gaming response time, decent black levels, and NO STUTTER during panning shots. This is like right on the edge of being a deal-breaker for me.\n\n1/30/23 - I will update when/if things change. 3/19/23. I still hate this tv. Love the picture quality but just HATE the way it operates and all the shortcomings. No more LG for me."

          "review": "Yes, I didn't give this a great rating because the engineers made way too many amateurish mistakes in the user interface. To show why is a long review ...\n\nThis TV lacks ATSC 3.0. In the end, I didn't care much because when I downloaded the manual of a very popular competitor's TV that \"had\" ATSC 3.0, the manual stated it wouldn't decode the high def content! Wow--not very useful. So, I wondered how many other TVs had the same limitation that \"claimed\" ATSC 3.0 which is why I removed that as a requirement.\n\nI personally feel that we are approaching the point of diminishing returns on how good TV displays look. Case in point, I looked at the TVs at Walmart & Target, which cost 1/3 this one and they don't look bad. Yes, you can see some color shifting at extreme angles, but still, not bad. As for more expensive TVs, I looked at the various reviews out there and my take is that you can measure differences in display quality amongst the ones costing more or less the same, but unless the TVs are sitting side by side, I think the display difference is barely perceptible, if at all (some reviews actually mention this). In the end, I decided to focus on the user interface of the TVs, not rely on reviewer's measurements.\n\nBefore I go into the remote and user interaction I want to discuss the poor upconversion when watching 480i TV. The jaggies are readily apparent and so bad, small text is difficult to read. It's like all they did was double the pixels and did little interpolation. I attempted to take some pictures. One is from live TV and the other is the same program recorded (and interpolated) by my HTPC. My HTPC with 10 year old software and processor uses a very basic linear interpolation algorithm and it outperforms this TV when displaying this content.\n\nOne thing I noticed when looking at the various TVs was some remotes didn't have numbers. Wow. I'm a TV watcher. I couldn't imagine scrolling through channels trying to get to the one I want.\n\nThe remote is an RF one, but the TV does support an IR one (you lose the \"mouse like cursor\" and I think the \"mouse wheel\" though). The first thing you notice is the buttons are kind of small and close together. I have small hands, so I didn't care.\n\nThe layout is bad. They didn't even try. No excuse--they've been making remotes for how many decades?? The volume up/down paddle is on the left. Below it is the home button, NOT the mute button (the mute button is in the center, where the home button should be). The \"go back to previous channel\" button is on the left, not on the right where the channel up/down paddle is. What this means is you'll be looking at your remote a lot.\n\nThen you notice the various input selection \"types\": up/down \"paddles\" for volume and channels; a ring that can be pressed up/down and maybe left/right; a mouse-like wheel; and don't forget the \"mouse cursor\". Why all of them? It's like rather than do a quality exercise by having various people interact with it and give feedback so they could select one or two, they just used all of them. One problem is all the real estate wasted by this. The other issue is, and this is really weird: the different buttons only work in certain situations. For example, when you start typing a channel number, a list pops up with the channels it could be. You can use the ring to move the selection up/down, but NOT the mouse wheel--apparently, it's function is (apparently only) to scroll to the next channel you are currently watching--it won't work to move the selection up/down. And you can't use the mouse cursor either. It's darn right amateurish, by engineering standards. Think about using a PC/Mac app and in one spot, you had to use the up/down arrows; in another spot you use the mouse, in yet another, you used the mouse wheel. It's maddening and makes it hard to use.\n\nThe \"go back\" ONLY deals with TV channels. It should go back to what was previously displayed on the TV. For example, if you were watching HDMI input 3 and jumped to TV channel 3.2, pressing the \"go back\" button should take you back to HDMI input 3. This is nice because it's a hack to act as a screensaver if you pause the video on an HDMI input. This display suffers from image retention, so if you get up to make popcorn, for example, you don't want a still image. Since there's no \"screen saver\" button (hint), this hack works nicely to quickly jump back and forth. My old Panasonic TV did this and I used it all the time.\n\nThe cursor is nice (and it's fun to use). The mouse wheel works pretty well. I think they found the sweet spot for how hard it is to turn and falsely turning it. However, the wheel is a selection button as well, and a couple of times when scrolling I inadvertently pushed too hard and selected something I didn't want. Also, when scrolling through the up/down submenu for channel selection, I have hit that wheel causing a channel change that I didn't want.\n\nThe remote has a bunch of largish \"quick jump\" buttons on the bottom for jumping to various streaming services. However, they take up valuable real estate. I'd rather they were smaller or replaced by a row of smaller buttons you could program to the stream of choice. There's some small colored buttons (have yet to determine their purpose) and maybe they would suffice.\n\nThe RF remote has a voice input. I was looking forward to trying it out, but it only works if the TV is connected to the internet.\n\nWhen you power up an external device connected to HDMI, a popup appears asking if you want to go to that HDMI input. Nice, BUT, if you try to use the mouse wheel, it unselects the default \"Yes\", but doesn't select the other option (\"No\"). You have to use the ring for that.\n\nOne last note about the RF remote. There are a lot of clones for sale here and elsewhere. Beware. Some hint they are RF remotes when they aren't. And every non LG RF one I looked at appeared to be lacking a sticker on the back with the FCC ID. To be legal for sale/use in the U.S., each device emitting RF must have an FCC ID (that you can lookup) to verify it passed FCC tests. This is to ensure the safety of you and your neighbors. Imagine someone attached to some medical equipment that is interfered with by an illegal RF remote.\n\nUPDATE: I've had this awhile now. I've noticed glitches every now and then. Sometimes it's slow reacting to user input. It lost track of time (was like 10 hours off). I had to uncheck \"auto\" and set it manually to correct it. Time will tell if it will keep track of daylight savings time for me. Lastly, I was looking at the OTA content guide (\"what's on each channel\"--part of ATSC meta data). I moved the remote too quick which causes the cursor to display and then all the channel data blanked out. I had to exit out and come back in to get it to display the content.\n\nTo be fair--there have been two or three updates now for this TV (yikes--why so many?!). Maybe they fixed some of the glitches I'm seeing. However, I'm not a big fan of updating--my experience says you risk breaking something.\n\nAnd the weird layout of the remote is still driving me nuts. I wish a 3rd party would make a remote for these TVs."

Be patient, it's quite involved, but you'll be rewarded with a most stunning picture."

          "review": "This is my second LG and third led flat screen. The screen here is incredibly thin (at least at the top) and the whole unit was much lighter than my previous 65 inch. That made it easy to mount by myself. The picture is beautiful and because I have shades on all the windows of my TV room the brightness is more than adequate (knew OLEDs can have a brightness problem but this model--and the next higher--have been reviewed as quite good in the brightness area.) Because I had an LG previously, I am quite familiar with the controls and the options although the OS in much updated from my previous unit, but that is part of why I bought new. Now I can do any and all streaming directly from the TV without needing to go through my cable service and/or a Fire cube as I was doing. It is also very convenient that the TV controls the on/off of the new AV receiver I also just bought (down to only two remotes!). The only difficulty I had in getting everything setup was to get the lip sync correct which ended up requiring that I bypass any corrections from both the TV and Receiver. Amazon delivery was very good and fast and the extra service one gets with a purchase at this level was greatly appreciated."

They replaced the screen, not a board.\n\nI reiterate that the TV itself is a 5 — it’s got a fantastic picture and I have 30+ years of broadcast TV production experience so I know what I’m talking about.\n\nBut I’m only updating my rating to 4/5 instead of 5/5 because of LG’s service process.\n\nWhen I opened the original repair ticket, LG automatically provided troubleshooting recommendations. I had already followed the instructions that are available online and told them so. However, there’s no ability to attach a picture to the ticket and they automatically close the original ticket and then ask you to open a new ticket with all of the same information that was provided previously in case troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.\n\nOnce the second ticket was entered LG eventually asked for a picture but then they didn’t make it available to the repair facility so they asked for a picture as well.\n\nStart to finish, time to repair completion was about a week and the TV was not completely down during this time. But I think LG’s repair ticket workflow needs some tweaks\n\nOriginal review:\nWould have rated this 5 stars as it's a fantastic TV but yesterday a thin line developed top to bottom about 1/3 of the way in from the right edge. Have contacted LG for repair and will update my review based on the repair experience."

It’s easy to get to Netflix, Hulu, etc., easy to connect external devices. Initial setup is relatively simple, although I don’t like having to download yet another app (in this case the LG ThinQ app) in order to get started. There are a lot of settings menus and some of them have bizarre names that don’t really explain what the menu is for (e.g.“OLED Self-Care”), but overall I found it easy to navigate. I’m also a big fan of the Wii-style remote? Obviously it’s huge and clunky and has too many buttons, but the scroll wheel is cool and I use the point-and-click feature a ton more than I expected to.\n\nBasically, a great TV at a great price point. Can’t believe I got this for under 1k."

Of course you get stunning contrast, colors, and crisp 4K scenes, but I want to call out some lesser mentioned features that I’ve already come to love.\n\n- Magic remote: the Nintendo WII style cursor that allows you to navigate all apps either through traditional remote buttons or via the aim and click method is great - providing a new way of doing things but allowing you to still use traditional buttons. Also allows for equipment control to control my Samsung sound bar.\n- WebOS: unlike my older LG tv, now all my streaming apps are native to tv. I get to ditch the Fire tv cube for paramount plus and HBO max\n- Alexa integration works nicely\n- Game mode, presets like FPS, RPG etc make switching for each game super easy. Already this tv has given an upper edge in FPS games.\n- Sound- for some reason all sound is crisper\n- Airplay: iOS screen mirroring and airplay work great, as well as screen mirroring from my MacBook Pro. I didn’t realize this was a feature.\n\nOnly downside so far is the Picture in Picture / split screen not working (seen other reviewers having same experience). It would be great to be able to play a game and have Netflix in a PIP window. Hopefully future software updates will fix this."

          "review": "Should preface when I turned it on there was some texturing in the middle when all solid colors. This is somewhat normal. I did a pixel cleaning and it was 100% gone and haven’t noticed anything else. If this happens it’s alright it’s normal AND the panel does this cleaning automatically after being turned off. So you will notice if your screen has been on for a couple hours turning it off will not make the same click. It will then click off idk 20 minutes later with a little light at the bottom. Just wanted to preface with that knowledge as I feel I’m a bit more technologically inclined and was still a bit spooked by the texture. Now onto the actual tv. The panel looks perfect. HDR is really bright, colors pop, and blacks are perfect. Features include auto low latency mode meaning a pc or console connection instantly turns it to lowest latency. The input lag on this tv is lower than any panel I’ve ever used even a TN 144hz panel. Airplay 2 support means you can “cast” 1080p 60 hdr video with no loss of quality. I have to be honest even 720p video looks freaking awesome on this due to the super sampling. I personally also enjoy the interpolation this tv provides. Little to actually no artifacts with just fluid motion. Everything has worked correctly and consistently with this TV. This tv is perfect for gaming imo. Such low latency and VRR, GSync, and freesync all work correctly. No flickering, works all way down to 20hz, and even works correctly with my nividia gpu. Additionally this tv even supports Bluetooth if you want to not have the speakers going. The speakers though sound much better than I was expecting I have no desire to get any external equipment. They are very full and no mud even with super low or high frequencies. I’m not saying it’s better than a sound bar I’m just saying it’s definitely the best TV speakers I’ve ever heard. This review is a bit all round but honestly this tv is worth far more than the 1.3k I paid for the 55inch. When it came out it was high high 2k range. It has that level of quality and personally I wouldn’t even look at the c3 or g3 unless these are sold out. In short out of 100 I’d give it 100/100 this isn’t a rounding 5/5 it’s truly perfect and I have no complaints. Get it trust me you won’t be disappointed in the product."

          "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023",
          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "NOTE: LG recently released a firmware update to the LG C2 that substantially reduces the ABL auto-dimming! This makes it much more competitive to the PG4*UQ and other OLEDs without opening the service menu to disable those features.\n\nI hear a lot of issues people have with using a TV as a monitor, especially this one, but I haven't had any such issues. After setting it up properly, the only problem is the RWBG subpixel layout and having to turn it on along with my computer. But as someone that grew up with CRT monitors, having to press an extra button in addition to the power button is not even the slightest bit inconvenient. The thing that really kills this as a monitor is the subpixel layout.\nRWBG adds noticeable fringing and bleed on text on OSes calibrated for RGB subpixels. Turning subpixel rendering compensation off makes it tolerable, but it's still much harder to read than on a normal monitor, and some games use it regardless of OS settings with no obvious way to adjust it. For visual content like movies and games it isn't noticeable at all, however.\nAs long as you aren't planning to read a whole bunch, or if you sit further back and make your text bigger so the subpixels don't mess with the text as much, there isn't a single issue with using this as a computer monitor.\n\nI originally purchased the PG42UQ and PG48UQ instead, and got 2 dead 42's and one 48 that only survived for a few weeks before it spontaneously died. I'd like to compare some points on the C2 vs PG4*UQ:\n- The box on the C2 is thicker, the Styrofoam completely protects the screen unlike on the PG4*UQ where there are tons of gaps, the Styrofoam on the corners is also much thicker preventing drops from affecting the corners like what happened to BOTH of my PG42UQs, and the accessories and feet are placed in sane location unlike the strange Styrofoam origami that was both the PG42UQ and PG48UQ.\n- On both, the panel quality is fantastic. But on the C2, you can really tweak the settings until everything is perfect, especially if you have the service remote or other way to get into the service menu. This TV in particular can easily be color calibrated to make it shine in whatever environment you put it in with 22 point white balance adjustment, gamma curves, and multiple black/white level boosts and compensations.\n- The glossy screen is a boon as it leaves the blacks completely dark, vs. a matte screen like on the PG4*UQ where there is significant light bleed and blooming.\n- The C2's panel is much thicker and doesn't feel fragile compared to the dangerously paper-thin, basically unprotected edges on the PG4*UQ\n- The power button housing on the bottom doesn't bend easily and feel like it's going to snap off like on the PG4*UQ. It's also much thinner and less obnoxious to look at. Man, I hate \"gamer\" stuff.\n- In general, the design on the C2 is much more sleek, simple, and modern, allowing it to fit into the room better than the eye-catching \"gamer\" aesthetic on the PG4*UQ.\n- Due to the thicker panel backplate and rear cover design, the C2 is easier to lift safely without feeling like you're going to damage it.\n- All the cable managing on the C2 is in one spot on one side only, instead of top, right, and bottom.\n- With the right settings in Game Optimizer mode, the C2 can reach the same point-for-point performance metrics as the PG4*UQ, with only the peak brightness not being as good (but that doesn't matter as it dips substantially for both the second a scene starts getting bright, after which the difference is negligible).\n- The subpixel layout on the PG4*UQ is better for reading text. This is the only praise I have for it over the C2.\n- The refresh rate can be overclocked on the PG4*UQ to a staggering 138Hz! Wow, how impressive. Unfortunately, the difference visually between 120Hz and 138Hz is basically nonexistent, as someone that has compared the C2 at 120Hz and PG48UQ at 138Hz. The response time is still fantastic on both units regardless of mode.\n\nOverall, highly recommend this as both a TV and a monitor. I don't use the smart features and leave it disconnected from the network, and unlike with other smart TV platforms, the C2 doesn't annoy you and simply lets you use it without the smart feature bloat impeding you. And if I want to consume content and use the motion smoothing etc. features, they're there at a press of the button. I don't think all the massive number of problems with the ASUS units make the overclocking or other small extra features worth it; and at the same time, the C2 offers some nice features of its own that the PG4*UQ doesn't have. I would highly recommend it as a multimon replacement as I am, if you're willing to live with the subpixel layout and having to turn the TV on and off separately to the connected PC; do note there is a Windows-only, community-maintained companion app, which I can't use as I don't use Windows."

          "review": "I recently purchased a TV from this seller on Amazon, and I must say that the experience has been nothing short of outstanding. From the moment I placed the order to the prompt delivery, everything went incredibly smoothly.\n\nFirst and foremost, the TV itself is a gem. The picture quality is absolutely breathtaking, with vibrant colors and crisp details that bring every scene to life. The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience. I find myself completely immersed in my favorite movies and TV shows, thanks to this remarkable television.\n\nWhat truly sets this seller apart, though, is their exceptional customer service. Throughout the entire process, they were attentive, responsive, and went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction. They promptly answered all my pre-purchase questions, providing detailed information and expert advice to help me make an informed decision. Their dedication to customer satisfaction was evident from start to finish.\n\nFurthermore, the packaging was done with utmost care and attention to detail. The TV arrived in perfect condition, securely protected against any potential damage during transit. It was evident that the seller takes great pride in their products and values the customer's experience.\n\nI also appreciated the easy setup process. The instructions provided were clear and concise, allowing me to have the TV up and running in no time. It's always a pleasure when a product lives up to its promises, and this TV certainly exceeded my expectations.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase from this seller on Amazon. They have proven themselves to be reliable, trustworthy, and committed to delivering an exceptional customer experience. If you're in the market for a new TV, I highly recommend considering their offerings. I will undoubtedly turn to them for any future electronic needs. Kudos to the seller for their outstanding product and impeccable service!"

          "review": "Version: 77 inch\nSeller: Amazon\nDelivery by: NSD (more about this at the bottom)\nPhoto 1: 68\" width. Will need large tv stand to look \"right\".\nPhoto 2: Mid-day reflection handling.\nPhoto 3: Inputs are on the left side of the set. Thin screen, but a wider portion holds the internals.\n\nFirst, the product.\n\nThe picture is fantastic. Viewing high bit-rate content such as Blu-rays is amazing. Ultra HD (2160p) HDR content is flawless and Full HD (1080p) SDR content is handled well. I like the upscaling of my Nvidia Shield for 1080p-> 4K upscaling over the TV’s, but most individuals will find no issues. The ability to turn off pixels for true black allows for an amazing contrast of color and blacks.\n\nThis TV supports high frame rate video game consoles with up to 120 FPS and offers a variable refresh rate (VRR) for gaming that isn’t locked at a steady 120/60/30 FPS. VRR ensures that games that support it will appear smoother and free of the screen tearing that is normally associated with frame rates that don’t match the TV. For PS5 owners, this means games that support a 40 FPS mode can be fully enjoyed on this TV. For PC owners, your 60-120 FPS experience will be similar to a good monitor, plus the amazing features of a top-tier TV. Also, input latency while in game mode is untouchable by non-OLED displays.\n\nThe TV speakers sound fine for daytime TV programming, but I utilize the TV’s eARC feature to send audio to my sound system. This feature works fine and is only a menu toggle away. Unfortunately, I can’t speak on the audio performance beyond this.\n\nThe set handles reflections well, but that doesn’t mean they disappear. This brings me to my one issue with this set, which is an issue shared with most OLEDs. OLED does not get extremely bright. If you intend to use this set in a living room with many windows, I suggest black-out curtains for the best viewing. If you cannot control the light in your room, I recommend considering a high-end LED TV instead, as they can get much brighter than OLEDs.\n\nAs for the TV’s operating system, I find the remote’s “motion as a mouse pointer” a little annoying sometimes, but hardly worth docking stars. Very usable system. The TV handles streaming 4K content from YouTube, Disney, Plex, and other services without issue. The perk of a major brand is knowing popular apps will work without a problem. This remains the case with this set.\n\nLastly, I must discuss my delivery experience. A special freight delivery service is needed for a delivery item of this size. NSD handled fulfillment. My experience was abysmal.\n\nDelivery must be scheduled. A signature is required for delivery, and the item will be placed inside your door (allegedly). NSD was a no-call and no-show on the day of delivery, and they did not reach out to reschedule. I attempted to call NSD for rescheduling three times, was hung up on twice by their system while waiting, and the third time resulted in being told that the local office would call to reschedule. After three more days of no contact, I had to contact chat support another three times over three days, asking to be contacted to reschedule. The second chat said NSD would escalate my delivery due to a no-call no-show. The third chat let me know that had not been done but assured me that they would. The sixth time is the charm. Delivery tracking showed the TV in town for an entire week before delivery was “attempted” and another week before the company finally called to deliver (no rescheduling of delivery, just delivery with only a few minutes warning). I live on a military installation, and the delivery team said they were not able to come onto the installation. This can be the result of several things: a lie, laziness, criminal history of one or both delivery members, or drugs/weapons in the delivery vehicle. As the company did not call to reschedule, I was out of town when they called me for delivery. Fortunately, I had a coworker I trusted to accept delivery off-base and hold the TV at his home until I was able to return.\n\nAs the delivery was not fulfilled by Amazon and the product itself is great, I am not deducting from my rating for this experience. However, let this be a horror story of delivery for potential buyers of the 77” version. If you have to buy online because you are rural like me, select NSD as an absolute last resort. A $2,400 purchase can be quite stressful when no one wants to talk to you about its delivery."

          "review": "After lots of online research and in-store viewing I settled on a previous year model 77\" screen OLED, the LGC2-PUA (not for WalMart or Cosco) model. It has more features than I will regularly use and has the best features of the things I want. The newer G2 isn't really a better product if you can get this model.\n\nI settled on this early for picture quality, but hesitated because other reviews noted the interface as difficult or annoying. Then, I discovered some online videos showing hidden menu features to simplify the display and eliminate those same annoyances that others complained about, but apparently missed the tips on. The menu does SOME self-explaining, but you will need to read about the effects if you want to go mess with a DIY calibration for your room. Default isn't too bad, but there are lots of tweaks you can use to get the best in your home.\n\nI have 81 near-flawless hours on the set after gaining operating tips online for tweaking settings. It displays well even in moderately bright day, as long as direct sun isn't hitting the screen, Evening viewing is quite stunning allowing a change of settings for more depth and color. The screen can be very reflective of lamps and other light sources, but we have overhead lighting so don't have an issue there. Off-axis viewing is decent especially in the vertical as we can watch from the upstairs internal balcony. The unit has a self-cleaning feature at shutdown that refreshes pixels every few hours so that burn-in isn't likely.\n\nSet-up was quick and we followed basic LG advice for unpacking. The stand went on easily but does require two people; one to to position & hold the screen until the through-screws can anchor the pedestal to the set. A/V connectors are placed on the side and easily accessible. Premium-capacity HDMI WILL BE a necessary expense to preserve best quality, but there are many reasonably-priced options.\n\nWe route sound to wired, external speakers with a Denon AVR but the TV sound is not too bad with the AI tweaks built-in, and would work OK in a small room setting.\n\nIt WAS more than I intended to spend (after the existing 2014 65\" plasma died) but has been well-worth the money in quality and performance."

          "rating": "4.0",
          "review": "This really is the best picture quality in the biz. Anything better is only by a small margin in very technical ways that very few users will notice, or need very specific types of scenes in order to display their upper hand. I have a few Samsung QLED displays of varying quality and this blows them away (although Neo QLEDs are closer in match, still not that close). I was sick of inconsistent blacks, backlighting blooming, and other typical LED issues and this TV does not have any of those issues. But I left a little wanting on the software. Here's the breakdown.\n\nPicture Quality 5/5:\nIt's simply the best. Viewing angles are great, contrast is great, HDR and Dolby Vision content is looks spectacular, backlighting is perfect. I had issues with all of these items on my Samsung QLEDs - the blacks and backlighting just completely drove me nuts with those, especially in dark scenes. Practically no viewing angle on a QLED, this you can look at it from 178 degrees with no color degradation. New OLEDs are pretty bright - I live near Phoenix AZ so it's bright everyday, and this is in a North facing living room with big windows. I leave my blinds open all day in there and there are no issues with brightness. So don't listen to people who say it's not bright enough, unless maybe you plan on using this outside in the sun. I will say that the front is more of a reflective glossy surface, so keep in mind lights behind you that may reflect on the tv. I also thought I damaged the panel mounting it to the wall because there were a lot of vertical lines when I turned it on, especially on the left, but after running the Pixel Cleaning cycle on the OLED Panel Care menu the lines completely went away so that's kinda cool.\n\nSoftware 4/5:\nI do like the software on Samsung better. This isn't BAD per-say... it just isn't great. Menus are as clean and easy as the Samsung home screen, or the mini menu that pops over the current content (I don't think LG even has that, just goes to the main home screen). I have a Samsung frame, and that gallery software blows the LG gallery software out of the water. Also not sure you can really compare because a true gallery option isn't really an option due to OLED burn in - you really don't want it displaying one image all day. Alexa kinda doesn't work as well as my Samsung as well. However, I do like that it shows as always on so that I can beam some Airplay content from my phone while the tv is off and it just turns on and goes to my selection.\n\nRemote 4/5:\nEh it's fine. I like the pointer feature, it's better than a wii remote, but if you accidentally scroll the center button instead of click when not using the pointer it switches to pointer and that's annoying. It's also huge! Well, by modern standards. Apple TV remotes are small and maybe too sparse on buttons, but I like the new Samsung remotes that are slim and have the solar charger on the back. They are also bluetooth so you don't need an IR line-of-sight to work. There are a ton of unnecessary buttons on the LG remote. They need to sexy it up and simplify the button layout and switch to BT instead of IR and that would get them back into the modern day remote.\n\nSound 3/5:\nIt's fine - all modern tvs are bad cause they are so slim but this is actually ok. I use their S90QY soundbar/subwoofer so not an issue for me (separate review for that). But why would you buy this tv and go for sub-par sound? Go treat yourself to a nice hometheater, you won't regret the addition.\n\nAesthetics 5/5:\nIt's pretty sexy. People who come over always comment on how thin it is. I have it mounted to the wall with a 0.6\" thick wall mount so that's about as close to the wall as you can get. The bezels are smaller than any other display I've seen. The stand it comes with is unnecessarily big and bulky in my opinion but yeah it looks better on the wall anyways. It's definitely a statement piece in the living room.\n\nDolby Atmos/Dolby Vision 5/5:\nWhenever I stream content that supports this format, it shows a little popover in the top right for a few seconds telling me that it's using that format and my soundbar switches to the right audio profile setting over the e-Arc connection, and the content looks and sounds perfect. Feels like I have the best home theater around. You have to try hard to find it's flaws. Best viewing experience I have ever had.\n\nSummary:\nBest in class viewing experience for the money. They could improve the software and remote a bit, but they aren't unusable and just take a bit of adjusting. Definitely need a good Dolby Atmos capable sound system to really maximize the experience. LG may have finally gotten me off Samsung displays, but now Samsung is hot on their heels with new OLED panels coming out. In 2023, I'd say buy LG C2 OLED (C3 only has marginal improvements for a higher price). We'll see who comes out on top in 2024."

          "review": "This TV is the absolute best I have ever owned, no question. It performs very well in dimly lit and brightly lit rooms. The picture is phenomenal, and I absolutely love the myriad of settings to fine-tune everything exactly how I want.\n\nI game pretty extensively, and my experience of this TV with my Playstation 5 has been excellent! It makes for a great gaming experience, can handle everything that the PS5 is capable of, and I simply love the 'game mode' that the TV has, complete with being able to select the type of game I am playing and it automatically adjusts several settings to match the game.\n\nA big plus for me is the screen burn prevention technology that this TV comes with. The ever so slight dimming of static displays on the screen (a HUD in virtually every game I play), and minor, periodic repositioning of those static images to help prevent screen burn are great! You legitimately don't even notice either feature unless you are really paying attention to it, but it does enough that I have yet to have a single issue with screen burn in the last nearly 4 months of heavy gaming. The TV looks just as good right now as it did when it first came out of the box.\n\nMy ONLY knock on this TV, and it is a relatively minor issue, is that is occasionally thinks I'm talking to it to issue a command when I'm simply gaming with friends. Can be a minor distraction when the prompt comes up on the screen, but it's not a major issue. I ensured that I have the setting off that would allow for hands-free Alexa control, instead opting for it to function under the push-and-hold of the Alexa button on the remote, but somehow that doesn't seem to stop the TV from infrequently trying to operate hands-free regardless. Again, not a huge issue, just a minor annoyance. Everything else that this TV offers far outweighs such a minor thing, so my rating remains at 5 stars.\n\nSimply put, if you want a fantastic OLED TV that definitely delivers on what it promises, the C2 is the way to go. I see that the C3 is about to launch, but the 65\" C2 at under $1700 is perfect for me. I don't have any desire to pay $2500 for the 65\" C3 for what is very likely a minor upgrade, if any at all. I'd have to imagine the C3 might have some software and/or UI changes that may somehow improve general quality-of-life, but I find it very unlikely that the screen quality and image quality of the C3 will be any different. Short of being an 8K resolution, there's nothing I can see where it could be improved. (8K is absolutely useless right now anyway; essentially no media content is in 8K).\n\nPerfect TV without draining your savings account! I may end up buying a second one for my bedroom, in all honesty. It's that good."

          "review": "For me, a TV is 50/50 picture/convenience. This is a zero on convenience. (Update 3/19/23 I'll Never buy an LG tv again).\n\nForget the nonsense about \"oleds don't get that bright\". People are just saying stuff that they hear the pros saying because it's a couple hundred nits lower than an LED set. It's plenty bright for HDR highlights and daytime viewing. I have to squint my eyes. And if you're like most people who work a 9-5 and mostly watch tv in the evenings - you'll find it bright enough. Come on people.\n\nLet's start with the UGLY:\n\nCEC: NIGHTMARE\nI have a PS5, XBSX, Shield Pro. Whether these devices are all plugged into tv then ARC-> Yamaha receiver, -OR- everything plugged into a new Denon 760H receiver then eARC-> tv, it's equally faulty. The tv likes to turn on my PS5 whenever I hit the input button (it shows the row of inputs first like it should, but then turns on and switches to PS5, also whenever I hit the back button from the ThinQ menu (I need to remember to hit the HOME button instead) and other odd buttons it fires up the PS5. Last night it did this when I hit the settings button ?!? Cannot get the Shield Pro to turn the tv on when it powers on. Yet, it will turn the tv on when it's connected to my 10 year old Yamaha receiver (eARC to tv).\nThe Universal Control Management is terrible. So much bloated crap on this TV.\n\nAuto-resume?!? Pause while watching netflix. 3 minutes later it starts playing. Watching something on plex- exit to home screen. 5 min later it switches to Plex and resumes movie.\n\nALEXA: HORRIBLE\nThis has to be the WORST Alexa integration EVER. My 3 year old Sony 900h connected on day one and has been FLAWLESS. Same with my $400 TCL roku tv. I say \"Alexa, turn off xxx tv\" and it would work 100% of the time. NOT ON THIS TV. It took me a week to troubleshoot, uninstalling apps, reinstalling (why are there 2 different LG devices on the Alexa app?!?). I'd say it works 10% of the time. Usually it says \"LG tv is not responding, please check it's network and power connection). If I grab the LG remote and hit the Alexa button and tell it to turn off it will work. But I could obviously just hit the power button on the remote.\n\nUPDATE: try calling the Tv \"tv\" instead of \"lg tv\" . ALSO-\" the tv has its own Alexa built in. Our echo dots are all named \"echo\" so this actually works quite well. Try calling \"alexa\" to the tv and issuing command. This has been working lately rather than telling my dot \"echo, pause the tv\". We'll see tomorrow. /update. (This still only works 50% of the time. Usually says \" network error\". 3/19/23)\n\nLEARNING CURVE: STEEP AF\nMake sure to register at AVSFORUM and read up/post your questions. The menu settings are very confusing and oddly placed. Read the manual, do your research. Go onto RTINGS.\n\nREMOTE: LOVE/HATE\nThe pointer wheel is kind of cool and probably quicker most of the time. It's like using a Wii remote but far more accurate and stable. The problem is when you just want to click over and select something (by pressing the wheel in). But my finger slips and instead of pressing the wheel in it turns the wheel which brings up the pointer and takes much longer to do what I need to do. There's also no Play/Pause button, you need to press in the wheel.\n\nI consider myself a person of average intelligence but it's 2023 All remotes should have 3 things MANDATORY:\n1. ALL buttons need to light up when lifted (like the Shield remote).\n2. There ABSOLUTELY NEEDS to be a sliding LOCK BUTTON to prevent accidental button press (and kid mischief).\n3. It needs to have a remote finder. Go into the app, hit a button, the remote makes a sound.\n(4). It would be nice to have a few learning buttons and customizable app buttons, not just Netflix.\n\n\"Gallery\" feature is a missed opportunity. It only appears if you are on an external input after the device has been powered off. Or you can select the gallery app manually. Here's a stellar idea - why not use the gallery as the screensaver instead of the ugly fireworks or clock?\n\nGAMING: SUPERB\nPlaying Horizon Forbidden West on PS5 at 60+ FPS in 4K is absolutely ASSAULTING on the eyes. It looks incredible! TV is responsive in regards to input lag and response time. When the tv is in GAME MODE, hitting the options button on the TV brings up the GAME menu which shows you all the gaming-related options and displays the current FPS on screen. Very nice.\n\nMOVIES: OBJECTIVE\nNo TV is perfect. Side viewing angle is big for me. I can see the color washout sitting 12\" over on the couch while watching my Sony 900h LCD tv. Unacceptable. This TV has an AWESOME VIEWING ANGLE. Go to RTINGS to view and compare. There is no discernable color/luminance washout in any seat in my living room. You need to go off to the extreme right/left to notice it.\n\nMy dvd backups played via PLEX app on TV look incredible, thanks to the rich OLED blacks. 1080p BD rips also look fantastic (compared to my LCD SONY 900h). And of course 4k content looks great. We all know about the \"inky\" blacks of OLED, no need to talk about it. Image quality is the best I've seen.\n\nSTUTTER/(Judder?):\nThis is a big one for me. During panning shots, usually when there is something tall and thin not moving on the screen there is a HORRIBLE STUTTER effect. It's jaggy and looks like the picture can't keep up. It's extremely jarring and takes me right out of the experience. This is due to the extremely fast response time of OLED technology. I find it extremely undesirable and a flaw. Options to mitigate this will introduce the Soap Opera effect, which is worse IMO.\n\nSOUND OUTPUT\nSound on the tv is fine. The usual. Sound output via ARC/eARC will only output the basics: stereo, Atmos, Dolby Digital and (DD+) to your receiver. And there is a difference between this DD and the DD you will find on a DVD/Blu Ray. It's a much more boring, stripped-down version (as with the Atmos I have heard) It's a lower bitrate signal. But it will suffice if you're going for a true 1-remote system. The TV will NOT OUTPUT DTS, DTS-MA, DD True HD via ARC/eARC. ***UPDATE: RECENT NEWS INFORMED THAT LG MIGHT START OFFERING DTS OUTPUT VIA ARC. IT'S UNSURE WHETHER THIS TV WILL RECEIVE THIS UPDATE*** Go onto RTINGS to check this info. Most TV's these days do not support outputting hi res audio signals which is unfortunate. The Nvidia Shield Pro is the recommended set-top box if hi-res audio is important to you.\n\nwebOS: fine\nEveryone seems to hate on the webOS. Look, they ALL have ads. I much prefer the Google Android (SONY tv, Shield) OS. But this one is fine. It offers all the apps I need: Netflix HBO MAX, Hulu, Disney +, and all the other ones, and displays them in a row at the bottom of the screen. You can easily go to what you want without looking or noticing all the other ads and crap on the tv. There is also another \"ThinQ\" app home screen where you can look at more crap you will probably never use. I stay away from all of this and hit my buttons very precisely otherwise one wrong move and I will launch the PS5 or some other device via CEC.\n\nHINT: If your PS5 (maybe other devices too) does turn on, hit the (...) button on the LG remote to bring up a menu where you can put the PS5 back into sleep mode.\n\nEYES\nIt took about 6 weeks for my eyes to adjust to this tv. Not sure of it was the detail, the brightness (it's plenty bright for me) or the blue light - whatever - my eyes got strained. It felt like a dull pressure behind my eyeballs. I'm 43 and perhaps I have some eye issues, so this is objective. I'm sort of used to it now, however I do start to feel eye strain in excess of 2/3 hours. Sooner if gaming.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: WOULD I BUY THIS TV AGAIN?\nI don't think so, especially now with other brands (SONY) offering OLED. I just don't think I should have so much to complain about with a $2500 tv. I would expect it with HiSense, TCL, Westinghouse basement bargain garage sale tvs, but not with a top shelf LG OLED.\n\nI would NOT choose OLED if there was another tech that offered similar gaming response time, decent black levels, and NO STUTTER during panning shots. This is like right on the edge of being a deal-breaker for me.\n\n1/30/23 - I will update when/if things change. 3/19/23. I still hate this tv. Love the picture quality but just HATE the way it operates and all the shortcomings. No more LG for me."

          "review": "Yes, I didn't give this a great rating because the engineers made way too many amateurish mistakes in the user interface. To show why is a long review ...\n\nThis TV lacks ATSC 3.0. In the end, I didn't care much because when I downloaded the manual of a very popular competitor's TV that \"had\" ATSC 3.0, the manual stated it wouldn't decode the high def content! Wow--not very useful. So, I wondered how many other TVs had the same limitation that \"claimed\" ATSC 3.0 which is why I removed that as a requirement.\n\nI personally feel that we are approaching the point of diminishing returns on how good TV displays look. Case in point, I looked at the TVs at Walmart & Target, which cost 1/3 this one and they don't look bad. Yes, you can see some color shifting at extreme angles, but still, not bad. As for more expensive TVs, I looked at the various reviews out there and my take is that you can measure differences in display quality amongst the ones costing more or less the same, but unless the TVs are sitting side by side, I think the display difference is barely perceptible, if at all (some reviews actually mention this). In the end, I decided to focus on the user interface of the TVs, not rely on reviewer's measurements.\n\nBefore I go into the remote and user interaction I want to discuss the poor upconversion when watching 480i TV. The jaggies are readily apparent and so bad, small text is difficult to read. It's like all they did was double the pixels and did little interpolation. I attempted to take some pictures. One is from live TV and the other is the same program recorded (and interpolated) by my HTPC. My HTPC with 10 year old software and processor uses a very basic linear interpolation algorithm and it outperforms this TV when displaying this content.\n\nOne thing I noticed when looking at the various TVs was some remotes didn't have numbers. Wow. I'm a TV watcher. I couldn't imagine scrolling through channels trying to get to the one I want.\n\nThe remote is an RF one, but the TV does support an IR one (you lose the \"mouse like cursor\" and I think the \"mouse wheel\" though). The first thing you notice is the buttons are kind of small and close together. I have small hands, so I didn't care.\n\nThe layout is bad. They didn't even try. No excuse--they've been making remotes for how many decades?? The volume up/down paddle is on the left. Below it is the home button, NOT the mute button (the mute button is in the center, where the home button should be). The \"go back to previous channel\" button is on the left, not on the right where the channel up/down paddle is. What this means is you'll be looking at your remote a lot.\n\nThen you notice the various input selection \"types\": up/down \"paddles\" for volume and channels; a ring that can be pressed up/down and maybe left/right; a mouse-like wheel; and don't forget the \"mouse cursor\". Why all of them? It's like rather than do a quality exercise by having various people interact with it and give feedback so they could select one or two, they just used all of them. One problem is all the real estate wasted by this. The other issue is, and this is really weird: the different buttons only work in certain situations. For example, when you start typing a channel number, a list pops up with the channels it could be. You can use the ring to move the selection up/down, but NOT the mouse wheel--apparently, it's function is (apparently only) to scroll to the next channel you are currently watching--it won't work to move the selection up/down. And you can't use the mouse cursor either. It's darn right amateurish, by engineering standards. Think about using a PC/Mac app and in one spot, you had to use the up/down arrows; in another spot you use the mouse, in yet another, you used the mouse wheel. It's maddening and makes it hard to use.\n\nThe \"go back\" ONLY deals with TV channels. It should go back to what was previously displayed on the TV. For example, if you were watching HDMI input 3 and jumped to TV channel 3.2, pressing the \"go back\" button should take you back to HDMI input 3. This is nice because it's a hack to act as a screensaver if you pause the video on an HDMI input. This display suffers from image retention, so if you get up to make popcorn, for example, you don't want a still image. Since there's no \"screen saver\" button (hint), this hack works nicely to quickly jump back and forth. My old Panasonic TV did this and I used it all the time.\n\nThe cursor is nice (and it's fun to use). The mouse wheel works pretty well. I think they found the sweet spot for how hard it is to turn and falsely turning it. However, the wheel is a selection button as well, and a couple of times when scrolling I inadvertently pushed too hard and selected something I didn't want. Also, when scrolling through the up/down submenu for channel selection, I have hit that wheel causing a channel change that I didn't want.\n\nThe remote has a bunch of largish \"quick jump\" buttons on the bottom for jumping to various streaming services. However, they take up valuable real estate. I'd rather they were smaller or replaced by a row of smaller buttons you could program to the stream of choice. There's some small colored buttons (have yet to determine their purpose) and maybe they would suffice.\n\nThe RF remote has a voice input. I was looking forward to trying it out, but it only works if the TV is connected to the internet.\n\nWhen you power up an external device connected to HDMI, a popup appears asking if you want to go to that HDMI input. Nice, BUT, if you try to use the mouse wheel, it unselects the default \"Yes\", but doesn't select the other option (\"No\"). You have to use the ring for that.\n\nOne last note about the RF remote. There are a lot of clones for sale here and elsewhere. Beware. Some hint they are RF remotes when they aren't. And every non LG RF one I looked at appeared to be lacking a sticker on the back with the FCC ID. To be legal for sale/use in the U.S., each device emitting RF must have an FCC ID (that you can lookup) to verify it passed FCC tests. This is to ensure the safety of you and your neighbors. Imagine someone attached to some medical equipment that is interfered with by an illegal RF remote.\n\nUPDATE: I've had this awhile now. I've noticed glitches every now and then. Sometimes it's slow reacting to user input. It lost track of time (was like 10 hours off). I had to uncheck \"auto\" and set it manually to correct it. Time will tell if it will keep track of daylight savings time for me. Lastly, I was looking at the OTA content guide (\"what's on each channel\"--part of ATSC meta data). I moved the remote too quick which causes the cursor to display and then all the channel data blanked out. I had to exit out and come back in to get it to display the content.\n\nTo be fair--there have been two or three updates now for this TV (yikes--why so many?!). Maybe they fixed some of the glitches I'm seeing. However, I'm not a big fan of updating--my experience says you risk breaking something.\n\nAnd the weird layout of the remote is still driving me nuts. I wish a 3rd party would make a remote for these TVs."

Be patient, it's quite involved, but you'll be rewarded with a most stunning picture."

          "review": "This is my second LG and third led flat screen. The screen here is incredibly thin (at least at the top) and the whole unit was much lighter than my previous 65 inch. That made it easy to mount by myself. The picture is beautiful and because I have shades on all the windows of my TV room the brightness is more than adequate (knew OLEDs can have a brightness problem but this model--and the next higher--have been reviewed as quite good in the brightness area.) Because I had an LG previously, I am quite familiar with the controls and the options although the OS in much updated from my previous unit, but that is part of why I bought new. Now I can do any and all streaming directly from the TV without needing to go through my cable service and/or a Fire cube as I was doing. It is also very convenient that the TV controls the on/off of the new AV receiver I also just bought (down to only two remotes!). The only difficulty I had in getting everything setup was to get the lip sync correct which ended up requiring that I bypass any corrections from both the TV and Receiver. Amazon delivery was very good and fast and the extra service one gets with a purchase at this level was greatly appreciated."

They replaced the screen, not a board.\n\nI reiterate that the TV itself is a 5 — it’s got a fantastic picture and I have 30+ years of broadcast TV production experience so I know what I’m talking about.\n\nBut I’m only updating my rating to 4/5 instead of 5/5 because of LG’s service process.\n\nWhen I opened the original repair ticket, LG automatically provided troubleshooting recommendations. I had already followed the instructions that are available online and told them so. However, there’s no ability to attach a picture to the ticket and they automatically close the original ticket and then ask you to open a new ticket with all of the same information that was provided previously in case troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.\n\nOnce the second ticket was entered LG eventually asked for a picture but then they didn’t make it available to the repair facility so they asked for a picture as well.\n\nStart to finish, time to repair completion was about a week and the TV was not completely down during this time. But I think LG’s repair ticket workflow needs some tweaks\n\nOriginal review:\nWould have rated this 5 stars as it's a fantastic TV but yesterday a thin line developed top to bottom about 1/3 of the way in from the right edge. Have contacted LG for repair and will update my review based on the repair experience."

It’s easy to get to Netflix, Hulu, etc., easy to connect external devices. Initial setup is relatively simple, although I don’t like having to download yet another app (in this case the LG ThinQ app) in order to get started. There are a lot of settings menus and some of them have bizarre names that don’t really explain what the menu is for (e.g.“OLED Self-Care”), but overall I found it easy to navigate. I’m also a big fan of the Wii-style remote? Obviously it’s huge and clunky and has too many buttons, but the scroll wheel is cool and I use the point-and-click feature a ton more than I expected to.\n\nBasically, a great TV at a great price point.

Of course you get stunning contrast, colors, and crisp 4K scenes, but I want to call out some lesser mentioned features that I’ve already come to love.\n\n- Magic remote: the Nintendo WII style cursor that allows you to navigate all apps either through traditional remote buttons or via the aim and click method is great - providing a new way of doing things but allowing you to still use traditional buttons. Also allows for equipment control to control my Samsung sound bar.\n- WebOS: unlike my older LG tv, now all my streaming apps are native to tv. I get to ditch the Fire tv cube for paramount plus and HBO max\n- Alexa integration works nicely\n- Game mode, presets like FPS, RPG etc make switching for each game super easy. Already this tv has given an upper edge in FPS games.\n- Sound- for some reason all sound is crisper\n- Airplay: iOS screen mirroring and airplay work great, as well as screen mirroring from my MacBook Pro. I didn’t realize this was a feature.\n\nOnly downside so far is the Picture in Picture / split screen not working (seen other reviewers having same experience). It would be great to be able to play a game and have Netflix in a PIP window. Hopefully future software updates will fix this."

          "review": "Should preface when I turned it on there was some texturing in the middle when all solid colors. This is somewhat normal. I did a pixel cleaning and it was 100% gone and haven’t noticed anything else. If this happens it’s alright it’s normal AND the panel does this cleaning automatically after being turned off. So you will notice if your screen has been on for a couple hours turning it off will not make the same click. It will then click off idk 20 minutes later with a little light at the bottom. Just wanted to preface with that knowledge as I feel I’m a bit more technologically inclined and was still a bit spooked by the texture. Now onto the actual tv. The panel looks perfect. HDR is really bright, colors pop, and blacks are perfect. Features include auto low latency mode meaning a pc or console connection instantly turns it to lowest latency. The input lag on this tv is lower than any panel I’ve ever used even a TN 144hz panel. Airplay 2 support means you can “cast” 1080p 60 hdr video with no loss of quality. I have to be honest even 720p video looks freaking awesome on this due to the super sampling. I personally also enjoy the interpolation this tv provides. Little to actually no artifacts with just fluid motion. Everything has worked correctly and consistently with this TV. This tv is perfect for gaming imo. Such low latency and VRR, GSync, and freesync all work correctly. No flickering, works all way down to 20hz, and even works correctly with my nividia gpu. Additionally this tv even supports Bluetooth if you want to not have the speakers going. The speakers though sound much better than I was expecting I have no desire to get any external equipment. They are very full and no mud even with super low or high frequencies. I’m not saying it’s better than a sound bar I’m just saying it’s definitely the best TV speakers I’ve ever heard. This review is a bit all round but honestly this tv is worth far more than the 1.3k I paid for the 55inch. When it came out it was high high 2k range. It has that level of quality and personally I wouldn’t even look at the c3 or g3 unless these are sold out. In short out of 100 I’d give it 100/100 this isn’t a rounding 5/5 it’s truly perfect and I have no complaints. Get it trust me you won’t be disappointed in the product."

          "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023",
          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "NOTE: LG recently released a firmware update to the LG C2 that substantially reduces the ABL auto-dimming! This makes it much more competitive to the PG4*UQ and other OLEDs without opening the service menu to disable those features.\n\nI hear a lot of issues people have with using a TV as a monitor, especially this one, but I haven't had any such issues. After setting it up properly, the only problem is the RWBG subpixel layout and having to turn it on along with my computer. But as someone that grew up with CRT monitors, having to press an extra button in addition to the power button is not even the slightest bit inconvenient. The thing that really kills this as a monitor is the subpixel layout.\nRWBG adds noticeable fringing and bleed on text on OSes calibrated for RGB subpixels. Turning subpixel rendering compensation off makes it tolerable, but it's still much harder to read than on a normal monitor, and some games use it regardless of OS settings with no obvious way to adjust it. For visual content like movies and games it isn't noticeable at all, however.\nAs long as you aren't planning to read a whole bunch, or if you sit further back and make your text bigger so the subpixels don't mess with the text as much, there isn't a single issue with using this as a computer monitor.\n\nI originally purchased the PG42UQ and PG48UQ instead, and got 2 dead 42's and one 48 that only survived for a few weeks before it spontaneously died. I'd like to compare some points on the C2 vs PG4*UQ:\n- The box on the C2 is thicker, the Styrofoam completely protects the screen unlike on the PG4*UQ where there are tons of gaps, the Styrofoam on the corners is also much thicker preventing drops from affecting the corners like what happened to BOTH of my PG42UQs, and the accessories and feet are placed in sane location unlike the strange Styrofoam origami that was both the PG42UQ and PG48UQ.\n- On both, the panel quality is fantastic. But on the C2, you can really tweak the settings until everything is perfect, especially if you have the service remote or other way to get into the service menu. This TV in particular can easily be color calibrated to make it shine in whatever environment you put it in with 22 point white balance adjustment, gamma curves, and multiple black/white level boosts and compensations.\n- The glossy screen is a boon as it leaves the blacks completely dark, vs. a matte screen like on the PG4*UQ where there is significant light bleed and blooming.\n- The C2's panel is much thicker and doesn't feel fragile compared to the dangerously paper-thin, basically unprotected edges on the PG4*UQ\n- The power button housing on the bottom doesn't bend easily and feel like it's going to snap off like on the PG4*UQ. It's also much thinner and less obnoxious to look at. Man, I hate \"gamer\" stuff.\n- In general, the design on the C2 is much more sleek, simple, and modern, allowing it to fit into the room better than the eye-catching \"gamer\" aesthetic on the PG4*UQ.\n- Due to the thicker panel backplate and rear cover design, the C2 is easier to lift safely without feeling like you're going to damage it.\n- All the cable managing on the C2 is in one spot on one side only, instead of top, right, and bottom.\n- With the right settings in Game Optimizer mode, the C2 can reach the same point-for-point performance metrics as the PG4*UQ, with only the peak brightness not being as good (but that doesn't matter as it dips substantially for both the second a scene starts getting bright, after which the difference is negligible).\n- The subpixel layout on the PG4*UQ is better for reading text. This is the only praise I have for it over the C2.\n- The refresh rate can be overclocked on the PG4*UQ to a staggering 138Hz! Wow, how impressive. Unfortunately, the difference visually between 120Hz and 138Hz is basically nonexistent, as someone that has compared the C2 at 120Hz and PG48UQ at 138Hz. The response time is still fantastic on both units regardless of mode.\n\nOverall, highly recommend this as both a TV and a monitor. I don't use the smart features and leave it disconnected from the network, and unlike with other smart TV platforms, the C2 doesn't annoy you and simply lets you use it without the smart feature bloat impeding you. And if I want to consume content and use the motion smoothing etc. features, they're there at a press of the button. I don't think all the massive number of problems with the ASUS units make the overclocking or other small extra features worth it; and at the same time, the C2 offers some nice features of its own that the PG4*UQ doesn't have. I would highly recommend it as a multimon replacement as I am, if you're willing to live with the subpixel layout and having to turn the TV on and off separately to the connected PC; do note there is a Windows-only, community-maintained companion app, which I can't use as I don't use Windows."

          "review": "I recently purchased a TV from this seller on Amazon, and I must say that the experience has been nothing short of outstanding. From the moment I placed the order to the prompt delivery, everything went incredibly smoothly.\n\nFirst and foremost, the TV itself is a gem. The picture quality is absolutely breathtaking, with vibrant colors and crisp details that bring every scene to life. The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience. I find myself completely immersed in my favorite movies and TV shows, thanks to this remarkable television.\n\nWhat truly sets this seller apart, though, is their exceptional customer service. Throughout the entire process, they were attentive, responsive, and went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction. They promptly answered all my pre-purchase questions, providing detailed information and expert advice to help me make an informed decision. Their dedication to customer satisfaction was evident from start to finish.\n\nFurthermore, the packaging was done with utmost care and attention to detail. The TV arrived in perfect condition, securely protected against any potential damage during transit. It was evident that the seller takes great pride in their products and values the customer's experience.\n\nI also appreciated the easy setup process. The instructions provided were clear and concise, allowing me to have the TV up and running in no time. It's always a pleasure when a product lives up to its promises, and this TV certainly exceeded my expectations.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase from this seller on Amazon. They have proven themselves to be reliable, trustworthy, and committed to delivering an exceptional customer experience. If you're in the market for a new TV, I highly recommend considering their offerings. I will undoubtedly turn to them for any future electronic needs. Kudos to the seller for their outstanding product and impeccable service!"

          "review": "Version: 77 inch\nSeller: Amazon\nDelivery by: NSD (more about this at the bottom)\nPhoto 1: 68\" width. Will need large tv stand to look \"right\".\nPhoto 2: Mid-day reflection handling.\nPhoto 3: Inputs are on the left side of the set. Thin screen, but a wider portion holds the internals.\n\nFirst, the product.\n\nThe picture is fantastic. Viewing high bit-rate content such as Blu-rays is amazing. Ultra HD (2160p) HDR content is flawless and Full HD (1080p) SDR content is handled well. I like the upscaling of my Nvidia Shield for 1080p-> 4K upscaling over the TV’s, but most individuals will find no issues. The ability to turn off pixels for true black allows for an amazing contrast of color and blacks.\n\nThis TV supports high frame rate video game consoles with up to 120 FPS and offers a variable refresh rate (VRR) for gaming that isn’t locked at a steady 120/60/30 FPS. VRR ensures that games that support it will appear smoother and free of the screen tearing that is normally associated with frame rates that don’t match the TV. For PS5 owners, this means games that support a 40 FPS mode can be fully enjoyed on this TV. For PC owners, your 60-120 FPS experience will be similar to a good monitor, plus the amazing features of a top-tier TV. Also, input latency while in game mode is untouchable by non-OLED displays.\n\nThe TV speakers sound fine for daytime TV programming, but I utilize the TV’s eARC feature to send audio to my sound system. This feature works fine and is only a menu toggle away. Unfortunately, I can’t speak on the audio performance beyond this.\n\nThe set handles reflections well, but that doesn’t mean they disappear. This brings me to my one issue with this set, which is an issue shared with most OLEDs. OLED does not get extremely bright. If you intend to use this set in a living room with many windows, I suggest black-out curtains for the best viewing. If you cannot control the light in your room, I recommend considering a high-end LED TV instead, as they can get much brighter than OLEDs.\n\nAs for the TV’s operating system, I find the remote’s “motion as a mouse pointer” a little annoying sometimes, but hardly worth docking stars. Very usable system. The TV handles streaming 4K content from YouTube, Disney, Plex, and other services without issue. The perk of a major brand is knowing popular apps will work without a problem. This remains the case with this set.\n\nLastly, I must discuss my delivery experience. A special freight delivery service is needed for a delivery item of this size. NSD handled fulfillment. My experience was abysmal.\n\nDelivery must be scheduled. A signature is required for delivery, and the item will be placed inside your door (allegedly). NSD was a no-call and no-show on the day of delivery, and they did not reach out to reschedule. I attempted to call NSD for rescheduling three times, was hung up on twice by their system while waiting, and the third time resulted in being told that the local office would call to reschedule. After three more days of no contact, I had to contact chat support another three times over three days, asking to be contacted to reschedule. The second chat said NSD would escalate my delivery due to a no-call no-show. The third chat let me know that had not been done but assured me that they would. The sixth time is the charm. Delivery tracking showed the TV in town for an entire week before delivery was “attempted” and another week before the company finally called to deliver (no rescheduling of delivery, just delivery with only a few minutes warning). I live on a military installation, and the delivery team said they were not able to come onto the installation. This can be the result of several things: a lie, laziness, criminal history of one or both delivery members, or drugs/weapons in the delivery vehicle. As the company did not call to reschedule, I was out of town when they called me for delivery. Fortunately, I had a coworker I trusted to accept delivery off-base and hold the TV at his home until I was able to return.\n\nAs the delivery was not fulfilled by Amazon and the product itself is great, I am not deducting from my rating for this experience. However, let this be a horror story of delivery for potential buyers of the 77” version. If you have to buy online because you are rural like me, select NSD as an absolute last resort. A $2,400 purchase can be quite stressful when no one wants to talk to you about its delivery."

          "review": "After lots of online research and in-store viewing I settled on a previous year model 77\" screen OLED, the LGC2-PUA (not for WalMart or Cosco) model. It has more features than I will regularly use and has the best features of the things I want. The newer G2 isn't really a better product if you can get this model.\n\nI settled on this early for picture quality, but hesitated because other reviews noted the interface as difficult or annoying. Then, I discovered some online videos showing hidden menu features to simplify the display and eliminate those same annoyances that others complained about, but apparently missed the tips on. The menu does SOME self-explaining, but you will need to read about the effects if you want to go mess with a DIY calibration for your room. Default isn't too bad, but there are lots of tweaks you can use to get the best in your home.\n\nI have 81 near-flawless hours on the set after gaining operating tips online for tweaking settings. It displays well even in moderately bright day, as long as direct sun isn't hitting the screen, Evening viewing is quite stunning allowing a change of settings for more depth and color. The screen can be very reflective of lamps and other light sources, but we have overhead lighting so don't have an issue there. Off-axis viewing is decent especially in the vertical as we can watch from the upstairs internal balcony. The unit has a self-cleaning feature at shutdown that refreshes pixels every few hours so that burn-in isn't likely.\n\nSet-up was quick and we followed basic LG advice for unpacking. The stand went on easily but does require two people; one to to position & hold the screen until the through-screws can anchor the pedestal to the set. A/V connectors are placed on the side and easily accessible. Premium-capacity HDMI WILL BE a necessary expense to preserve best quality, but there are many reasonably-priced options.\n\nWe route sound to wired, external speakers with a Denon AVR but the TV sound is not too bad with the AI tweaks built-in, and would work OK in a small room setting.\n\nIt WAS more than I intended to spend (after the existing 2014 65\" plasma died) but has been well-worth the money in quality and performance."

          "rating": "4.0",
          "review": "This really is the best picture quality in the biz. Anything better is only by a small margin in very technical ways that very few users will notice, or need very specific types of scenes in order to display their upper hand. I have a few Samsung QLED displays of varying quality and this blows them away (although Neo QLEDs are closer in match, still not that close). I was sick of inconsistent blacks, backlighting blooming, and other typical LED issues and this TV does not have any of those issues. But I left a little wanting on the software. Here's the breakdown.\n\nPicture Quality 5/5:\nIt's simply the best. Viewing angles are great, contrast is great, HDR and Dolby Vision content is looks spectacular, backlighting is perfect. I had issues with all of these items on my Samsung QLEDs - the blacks and backlighting just completely drove me nuts with those, especially in dark scenes. Practically no viewing angle on a QLED, this you can look at it from 178 degrees with no color degradation. New OLEDs are pretty bright - I live near Phoenix AZ so it's bright everyday, and this is in a North facing living room with big windows. I leave my blinds open all day in there and there are no issues with brightness. So don't listen to people who say it's not bright enough, unless maybe you plan on using this outside in the sun. I will say that the front is more of a reflective glossy surface, so keep in mind lights behind you that may reflect on the tv. I also thought I damaged the panel mounting it to the wall because there were a lot of vertical lines when I turned it on, especially on the left, but after running the Pixel Cleaning cycle on the OLED Panel Care menu the lines completely went away so that's kinda cool.\n\nSoftware 4/5:\nI do like the software on Samsung better. This isn't BAD per-say... it just isn't great. Menus are as clean and easy as the Samsung home screen, or the mini menu that pops over the current content (I don't think LG even has that, just goes to the main home screen). I have a Samsung frame, and that gallery software blows the LG gallery software out of the water. Also not sure you can really compare because a true gallery option isn't really an option due to OLED burn in - you really don't want it displaying one image all day. Alexa kinda doesn't work as well as my Samsung as well. However, I do like that it shows as always on so that I can beam some Airplay content from my phone while the tv is off and it just turns on and goes to my selection.\n\nRemote 4/5:\nEh it's fine. I like the pointer feature, it's better than a wii remote, but if you accidentally scroll the center button instead of click when not using the pointer it switches to pointer and that's annoying. It's also huge! Well, by modern standards. Apple TV remotes are small and maybe too sparse on buttons, but I like the new Samsung remotes that are slim and have the solar charger on the back. They are also bluetooth so you don't need an IR line-of-sight to work. There are a ton of unnecessary buttons on the LG remote. They need to sexy it up and simplify the button layout and switch to BT instead of IR and that would get them back into the modern day remote.\n\nSound 3/5:\nIt's fine - all modern tvs are bad cause they are so slim but this is actually ok. I use their S90QY soundbar/subwoofer so not an issue for me (separate review for that). But why would you buy this tv and go for sub-par sound? Go treat yourself to a nice hometheater, you won't regret the addition.\n\nAesthetics 5/5:\nIt's pretty sexy. People who come over always comment on how thin it is. I have it mounted to the wall with a 0.6\" thick wall mount so that's about as close to the wall as you can get. The bezels are smaller than any other display I've seen. The stand it comes with is unnecessarily big and bulky in my opinion but yeah it looks better on the wall anyways. It's definitely a statement piece in the living room.\n\nDolby Atmos/Dolby Vision 5/5:\nWhenever I stream content that supports this format, it shows a little popover in the top right for a few seconds telling me that it's using that format and my soundbar switches to the right audio profile setting over the e-Arc connection, and the content looks and sounds perfect. Feels like I have the best home theater around. You have to try hard to find it's flaws. Best viewing experience I have ever had.\n\nSummary:\nBest in class viewing experience for the money. They could improve the software and remote a bit, but they aren't unusable and just take a bit of adjusting. Definitely need a good Dolby Atmos capable sound system to really maximize the experience. LG may have finally gotten me off Samsung displays, but now Samsung is hot on their heels with new OLED panels coming out. In 2023, I'd say buy LG C2 OLED (C3 only has marginal improvements for a higher price). We'll see who comes out on top in 2024."

          "review": "This TV is the absolute best I have ever owned, no question. It performs very well in dimly lit and brightly lit rooms. The picture is phenomenal, and I absolutely love the myriad of settings to fine-tune everything exactly how I want.\n\nI game pretty extensively, and my experience of this TV with my Playstation 5 has been excellent! It makes for a great gaming experience, can handle everything that the PS5 is capable of, and I simply love the 'game mode' that the TV has, complete with being able to select the type of game I am playing and it automatically adjusts several settings to match the game.\n\nA big plus for me is the screen burn prevention technology that this TV comes with. The ever so slight dimming of static displays on the screen (a HUD in virtually every game I play), and minor, periodic repositioning of those static images to help prevent screen burn are great! You legitimately don't even notice either feature unless you are really paying attention to it, but it does enough that I have yet to have a single issue with screen burn in the last nearly 4 months of heavy gaming. The TV looks just as good right now as it did when it first came out of the box.\n\nMy ONLY knock on this TV, and it is a relatively minor issue, is that is occasionally thinks I'm talking to it to issue a command when I'm simply gaming with friends. Can be a minor distraction when the prompt comes up on the screen, but it's not a major issue. I ensured that I have the setting off that would allow for hands-free Alexa control, instead opting for it to function under the push-and-hold of the Alexa button on the remote, but somehow that doesn't seem to stop the TV from infrequently trying to operate hands-free regardless. Again, not a huge issue, just a minor annoyance. Everything else that this TV offers far outweighs such a minor thing, so my rating remains at 5 stars.\n\nSimply put, if you want a fantastic OLED TV that definitely delivers on what it promises, the C2 is the way to go. I see that the C3 is about to launch, but the 65\" C2 at under $1700 is perfect for me. I don't have any desire to pay $2500 for the 65\" C3 for what is very likely a minor upgrade, if any at all. I'd have to imagine the C3 might have some software and/or UI changes that may somehow improve general quality-of-life, but I find it very unlikely that the screen quality and image quality of the C3 will be any different. Short of being an 8K resolution, there's nothing I can see where it could be improved. (8K is absolutely useless right now anyway; essentially no media content is in 8K).\n\nPerfect TV without draining your savings account! I may end up buying a second one for my bedroom, in all honesty. It's that good."

(Update 3/19/23 I'll Never buy an LG tv again).\n\nForget the nonsense about \"oleds don't get that bright\". People are just saying stuff that they hear the pros saying because it's a couple hundred nits lower than an LED set. It's plenty bright for HDR highlights and daytime viewing. I have to squint my eyes. And if you're like most people who work a 9-5 and mostly watch tv in the evenings - you'll find it bright enough. Come on people.\n\nLet's start with the UGLY:\n\nCEC: NIGHTMARE\nI have a PS5, XBSX, Shield Pro. Whether these devices are all plugged into tv then ARC-> Yamaha receiver, -OR- everything plugged into a new Denon 760H receiver then eARC-> tv, it's equally faulty. The tv likes to turn on my PS5 whenever I hit the input button (it shows the row of inputs first like it should, but then turns on and switches to PS5, also whenever I hit the back button from the ThinQ menu (I need to remember to hit the HOME button instead) and other odd buttons it fires up the PS5. Last night it did this when I hit the settings button ?!? Cannot get the Shield Pro to turn the tv on when it powers on. Yet, it will turn the tv on when it's connected to my 10 year old Yamaha receiver (eARC to tv).\nThe Universal Control Management is terrible. So much bloated crap on this TV.\n\nAuto-resume?!? Pause while watching netflix. 3 minutes later it starts playing. Watching something on plex- exit to home screen. 5 min later it switches to Plex and resumes movie.\n\nALEXA: HORRIBLE\nThis has to be the WORST Alexa integration EVER. My 3 year old Sony 900h connected on day one and has been FLAWLESS. Same with my $400 TCL roku tv. I say \"Alexa, turn off xxx tv\" and it would work 100% of the time. NOT ON THIS TV. It took me a week to troubleshoot, uninstalling apps, reinstalling (why are there 2 different LG devices on the Alexa app?!?). I'd say it works 10% of the time. Usually it says \"LG tv is not responding, please check it's network and power connection). If I grab the LG remote and hit the Alexa button and tell it to turn off it will work. But I could obviously just hit the power button on the remote.\n\nUPDATE: try calling the Tv \"tv\" instead of \"lg tv\" . ALSO-\" the tv has its own Alexa built in. Our echo dots are all named \"echo\" so this actually works quite well. Try calling \"alexa\" to the tv and issuing command. This has been working lately rather than telling my dot \"echo, pause the tv\". We'll see tomorrow. /update. (This still only works 50% of the time. Usually says \" network error\". 3/19/23)\n\nLEARNING CURVE: STEEP AF\nMake sure to register at AVSFORUM and read up/post your questions. The menu settings are very confusing and oddly placed. Read the manual, do your research. Go onto RTINGS.\n\nREMOTE: LOVE/HATE\nThe pointer wheel is kind of cool and probably quicker most of the time. It's like using a Wii remote but far more accurate and stable. The problem is when you just want to click over and select something (by pressing the wheel in). But my finger slips and instead of pressing the wheel in it turns the wheel which brings up the pointer and takes much longer to do what I need to do. There's also no Play/Pause button, you need to press in the wheel.\n\nI consider myself a person of average intelligence but it's 2023 All remotes should have 3 things MANDATORY:\n1. ALL buttons need to light up when lifted (like the Shield remote).\n2. There ABSOLUTELY NEEDS to be a sliding LOCK BUTTON to prevent accidental button press (and kid mischief).\n3. It needs to have a remote finder. Go into the app, hit a button, the remote makes a sound.\n(4). It would be nice to have a few learning buttons and customizable app buttons, not just Netflix.\n\n\"Gallery\" feature is a missed opportunity. It only appears if you are on an external input after the device has been powered off. Or you can select the gallery app manually. Here's a stellar idea - why not use the gallery as the screensaver instead of the ugly fireworks or clock?\n\nGAMING: SUPERB\nPlaying Horizon Forbidden West on PS5 at 60+ FPS in 4K is absolutely ASSAULTING on the eyes. It looks incredible! TV is responsive in regards to input lag and response time. When the tv is in GAME MODE, hitting the options button on the TV brings up the GAME menu which shows you all the gaming-related options and displays the current FPS on screen. Very nice.\n\nMOVIES: OBJECTIVE\nNo TV is perfect. Side viewing angle is big for me. I can see the color washout sitting 12\" over on the couch while watching my Sony 900h LCD tv. Unacceptable. This TV has an AWESOME VIEWING ANGLE. Go to RTINGS to view and compare. There is no discernable color/luminance washout in any seat in my living room. You need to go off to the extreme right/left to notice it.\n\nMy dvd backups played via PLEX app on TV look incredible, thanks to the rich OLED blacks. 1080p BD rips also look fantastic (compared to my LCD SONY 900h). And of course 4k content looks great. We all know about the \"inky\" blacks of OLED, no need to talk about it. Image quality is the best I've seen.\n\nSTUTTER/(Judder?):\nThis is a big one for me. During panning shots, usually when there is something tall and thin not moving on the screen there is a HORRIBLE STUTTER effect. It's jaggy and looks like the picture can't keep up. It's extremely jarring and takes me right out of the experience. This is due to the extremely fast response time of OLED technology. I find it extremely undesirable and a flaw. Options to mitigate this will introduce the Soap Opera effect, which is worse IMO.\n\nSOUND OUTPUT\nSound on the tv is fine. The usual. Sound output via ARC/eARC will only output the basics: stereo, Atmos, Dolby Digital and (DD+) to your receiver. And there is a difference between this DD and the DD you will find on a DVD/Blu Ray. It's a much more boring, stripped-down version (as with the Atmos I have heard) It's a lower bitrate signal. But it will suffice if you're going for a true 1-remote system. The TV will NOT OUTPUT DTS, DTS-MA, DD True HD via ARC/eARC. ***UPDATE: RECENT NEWS INFORMED THAT LG MIGHT START OFFERING DTS OUTPUT VIA ARC. IT'S UNSURE WHETHER THIS TV WILL RECEIVE THIS UPDATE*** Go onto RTINGS to check this info. Most TV's these days do not support outputting hi res audio signals which is unfortunate. The Nvidia Shield Pro is the recommended set-top box if hi-res audio is important to you.\n\nwebOS: fine\nEveryone seems to hate on the webOS. Look, they ALL have ads. I much prefer the Google Android (SONY tv, Shield) OS. But this one is fine. It offers all the apps I need: Netflix HBO MAX, Hulu, Disney +, and all the other ones, and displays them in a row at the bottom of the screen. You can easily go to what you want without looking or noticing all the other ads and crap on the tv. There is also another \"ThinQ\" app home screen where you can look at more crap you will probably never use. I stay away from all of this and hit my buttons very precisely otherwise one wrong move and I will launch the PS5 or some other device via CEC.\n\nHINT: If your PS5 (maybe other devices too) does turn on, hit the (...) button on the LG remote to bring up a menu where you can put the PS5 back into sleep mode.\n\nEYES\nIt took about 6 weeks for my eyes to adjust to this tv. Not sure of it was the detail, the brightness (it's plenty bright for me) or the blue light - whatever - my eyes got strained. It felt like a dull pressure behind my eyeballs. I'm 43 and perhaps I have some eye issues, so this is objective. I'm sort of used to it now, however I do start to feel eye strain in excess of 2/3 hours. Sooner if gaming.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: WOULD I BUY THIS TV AGAIN?\nI don't think so, especially now with other brands (SONY) offering OLED. I just don't think I should have so much to complain about with a $2500 tv. I would expect it with HiSense, TCL, Westinghouse basement bargain garage sale tvs, but not with a top shelf LG OLED.\n\nI would NOT choose OLED if there was another tech that offered similar gaming response time, decent black levels, and NO STUTTER during panning shots. This is like right on the edge of being a deal-breaker for me.\n\n1/30/23 - I will update when/if things change. 3/19/23. I still hate this tv. Love the picture quality but just HATE the way it operates and all the shortcomings. No more LG for me."

          "review": "Yes, I didn't give this a great rating because the engineers made way too many amateurish mistakes in the user interface. To show why is a long review ...\n\nThis TV lacks ATSC 3.0. In the end, I didn't care much because when I downloaded the manual of a very popular competitor's TV that \"had\" ATSC 3.0, the manual stated it wouldn't decode the high def content! Wow--not very useful. So, I wondered how many other TVs had the same limitation that \"claimed\" ATSC 3.0 which is why I removed that as a requirement.\n\nI personally feel that we are approaching the point of diminishing returns on how good TV displays look. Case in point, I looked at the TVs at Walmart & Target, which cost 1/3 this one and they don't look bad. Yes, you can see some color shifting at extreme angles, but still, not bad. As for more expensive TVs, I looked at the various reviews out there and my take is that you can measure differences in display quality amongst the ones costing more or less the same, but unless the TVs are sitting side by side, I think the display difference is barely perceptible, if at all (some reviews actually mention this). In the end, I decided to focus on the user interface of the TVs, not rely on reviewer's measurements.\n\nBefore I go into the remote and user interaction I want to discuss the poor upconversion when watching 480i TV. The jaggies are readily apparent and so bad, small text is difficult to read. It's like all they did was double the pixels and did little interpolation. I attempted to take some pictures. One is from live TV and the other is the same program recorded (and interpolated) by my HTPC. My HTPC with 10 year old software and processor uses a very basic linear interpolation algorithm and it outperforms this TV when displaying this content.\n\nOne thing I noticed when looking at the various TVs was some remotes didn't have numbers. Wow. I'm a TV watcher. I couldn't imagine scrolling through channels trying to get to the one I want.\n\nThe remote is an RF one, but the TV does support an IR one (you lose the \"mouse like cursor\" and I think the \"mouse wheel\" though). The first thing you notice is the buttons are kind of small and close together. I have small hands, so I didn't care.\n\nThe layout is bad. They didn't even try. No excuse--they've been making remotes for how many decades?? The volume up/down paddle is on the left. Below it is the home button, NOT the mute button (the mute button is in the center, where the home button should be). The \"go back to previous channel\" button is on the left, not on the right where the channel up/down paddle is. What this means is you'll be looking at your remote a lot.\n\nThen you notice the various input selection \"types\": up/down \"paddles\" for volume and channels; a ring that can be pressed up/down and maybe left/right; a mouse-like wheel; and don't forget the \"mouse cursor\". Why all of them? It's like rather than do a quality exercise by having various people interact with it and give feedback so they could select one or two, they just used all of them. One problem is all the real estate wasted by this. The other issue is, and this is really weird: the different buttons only work in certain situations. For example, when you start typing a channel number, a list pops up with the channels it could be. You can use the ring to move the selection up/down, but NOT the mouse wheel--apparently, it's function is (apparently only) to scroll to the next channel you are currently watching--it won't work to move the selection up/down. And you can't use the mouse cursor either. It's darn right amateurish, by engineering standards. Think about using a PC/Mac app and in one spot, you had to use the up/down arrows; in another spot you use the mouse, in yet another, you used the mouse wheel. It's maddening and makes it hard to use.\n\nThe \"go back\" ONLY deals with TV channels. It should go back to what was previously displayed on the TV. For example, if you were watching HDMI input 3 and jumped to TV channel 3.2, pressing the \"go back\" button should take you back to HDMI input 3. This is nice because it's a hack to act as a screensaver if you pause the video on an HDMI input. This display suffers from image retention, so if you get up to make popcorn, for example, you don't want a still image. Since there's no \"screen saver\" button (hint), this hack works nicely to quickly jump back and forth. My old Panasonic TV did this and I used it all the time.\n\nThe cursor is nice (and it's fun to use). The mouse wheel works pretty well. I think they found the sweet spot for how hard it is to turn and falsely turning it. However, the wheel is a selection button as well, and a couple of times when scrolling I inadvertently pushed too hard and selected something I didn't want. Also, when scrolling through the up/down submenu for channel selection, I have hit that wheel causing a channel change that I didn't want.\n\nThe remote has a bunch of largish \"quick jump\" buttons on the bottom for jumping to various streaming services. However, they take up valuable real estate. I'd rather they were smaller or replaced by a row of smaller buttons you could program to the stream of choice. There's some small colored buttons (have yet to determine their purpose) and maybe they would suffice.\n\nThe RF remote has a voice input. I was looking forward to trying it out, but it only works if the TV is connected to the internet.\n\nWhen you power up an external device connected to HDMI, a popup appears asking if you want to go to that HDMI input. Nice, BUT, if you try to use the mouse wheel, it unselects the default \"Yes\", but doesn't select the other option (\"No\"). You have to use the ring for that.\n\nOne last note about the RF remote. There are a lot of clones for sale here and elsewhere. Beware. Some hint they are RF remotes when they aren't. And every non LG RF one I looked at appeared to be lacking a sticker on the back with the FCC ID. To be legal for sale/use in the U.S., each device emitting RF must have an FCC ID (that you can lookup) to verify it passed FCC tests. This is to ensure the safety of you and your neighbors. Imagine someone attached to some medical equipment that is interfered with by an illegal RF remote.\n\nUPDATE: I've had this awhile now. I've noticed glitches every now and then. Sometimes it's slow reacting to user input. It lost track of time (was like 10 hours off). I had to uncheck \"auto\" and set it manually to correct it. Time will tell if it will keep track of daylight savings time for me. Lastly, I was looking at the OTA content guide (\"what's on each channel\"--part of ATSC meta data). I moved the remote too quick which causes the cursor to display and then all the channel data blanked out. I had to exit out and come back in to get it to display the content.\n\nTo be fair--there have been two or three updates now for this TV (yikes--why so many?!). Maybe they fixed some of the glitches I'm seeing. However, I'm not a big fan of updating--my experience says you risk breaking something.\n\nAnd the weird layout of the remote is still driving me nuts. I wish a 3rd party would make a remote for these TVs."

Be patient, it's quite involved, but you'll be rewarded with a most stunning picture."

          "review": "This is my second LG and third led flat screen. The screen here is incredibly thin (at least at the top) and the whole unit was much lighter than my previous 65 inch. That made it easy to mount by myself. The picture is beautiful and because I have shades on all the windows of my TV room the brightness is more than adequate (knew OLEDs can have a brightness problem but this model--and the next higher--have been reviewed as quite good in the brightness area.) Because I had an LG previously, I am quite familiar with the controls and the options although the OS in much updated from my previous unit, but that is part of why I bought new. Now I can do any and all streaming directly from the TV without needing to go through my cable service and/or a Fire cube as I was doing. It is also very convenient that the TV controls the on/off of the new AV receiver I also just bought (down to only two remotes!). The only difficulty I had in getting everything setup was to get the lip sync correct which ended up requiring that I bypass any corrections from both the TV and Receiver. Amazon delivery was very good and fast and the extra service one gets with a purchase at this level was greatly appreciated."

They replaced the screen, not a board.\n\nI reiterate that the TV itself is a 5 — it’s got a fantastic picture and I have 30+ years of broadcast TV production experience so I know what I’m talking about.\n\nBut I’m only updating my rating to 4/5 instead of 5/5 because of LG’s service process.\n\nWhen I opened the original repair ticket, LG automatically provided troubleshooting recommendations. I had already followed the instructions that are available online and told them so. However, there’s no ability to attach a picture to the ticket and they automatically close the original ticket and then ask you to open a new ticket with all of the same information that was provided previously in case troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.\n\nOnce the second ticket was entered LG eventually asked for a picture but then they didn’t make it available to the repair facility so they asked for a picture as well.\n\nStart to finish, time to repair completion was about a week and the TV was not completely down during this time. But I think LG’s repair ticket workflow needs some tweaks\n\nOriginal review:\nWould have rated this 5 stars as it's a fantastic TV but yesterday a thin line developed top to bottom about 1/3 of the way in from the right edge. Have contacted LG for repair and will update my review based on the repair experience."

It’s easy to get to Netflix, Hulu, etc., easy to connect external devices. Initial setup is relatively simple, although I don’t like having to download yet another app (in this case the LG ThinQ app) in order to get started. There are a lot of settings menus and some of them have bizarre names that don’t really explain what the menu is for (e.g.“OLED Self-Care”), but overall I found it easy to navigate. I’m also a big fan of the Wii-style remote? Obviously it’s huge and clunky and has too many buttons, but the scroll wheel is cool and I use the point-and-click feature a ton more than I expected to.\n\nBasically, a great TV at a great price point. Can’t believe I got this for under 1k."

Of course you get stunning contrast, colors, and crisp 4K scenes, but I want to call out some lesser mentioned features that I’ve already come to love.\n\n- Magic remote: the Nintendo WII style cursor that allows you to navigate all apps either through traditional remote buttons or via the aim and click method is great - providing a new way of doing things but allowing you to still use traditional buttons. Also allows for equipment control to control my Samsung sound bar.\n- WebOS: unlike my older LG tv, now all my streaming apps are native to tv. I get to ditch the Fire tv cube for paramount plus and HBO max\n- Alexa integration works nicely\n- Game mode, presets like FPS, RPG etc make switching for each game super easy. Already this tv has given an upper edge in FPS games.\n- Sound- for some reason all sound is crisper\n- Airplay: iOS screen mirroring and airplay work great, as well as screen mirroring from my MacBook Pro. I didn’t realize this was a feature.\n\nOnly downside so far is the Picture in Picture / split screen not working (seen other reviewers having same experience). It would be great to be able to play a game and have Netflix in a PIP window. Hopefully future software updates will fix this."

          "review": "Should preface when I turned it on there was some texturing in the middle when all solid colors. This is somewhat normal. I did a pixel cleaning and it was 100% gone and haven’t noticed anything else. If this happens it’s alright it’s normal AND the panel does this cleaning automatically after being turned off. So you will notice if your screen has been on for a couple hours turning it off will not make the same click. It will then click off idk 20 minutes later with a little light at the bottom. Just wanted to preface with that knowledge as I feel I’m a bit more technologically inclined and was still a bit spooked by the texture. Now onto the actual tv. The panel looks perfect. HDR is really bright, colors pop, and blacks are perfect. Features include auto low latency mode meaning a pc or console connection instantly turns it to lowest latency. The input lag on this tv is lower than any panel I’ve ever used even a TN 144hz panel. Airplay 2 support means you can “cast” 1080p 60 hdr video with no loss of quality. I have to be honest even 720p video looks freaking awesome on this due to the super sampling. I personally also enjoy the interpolation this tv provides. Little to actually no artifacts with just fluid motion. Everything has worked correctly and consistently with this TV. This tv is perfect for gaming imo. Such low latency and VRR, GSync, and freesync all work correctly. No flickering, works all way down to 20hz, and even works correctly with my nividia gpu. Additionally this tv even supports Bluetooth if you want to not have the speakers going. The speakers though sound much better than I was expecting I have no desire to get any external equipment. They are very full and no mud even with super low or high frequencies. I’m not saying it’s better than a sound bar I’m just saying it’s definitely the best TV speakers I’ve ever heard. This review is a bit all round but honestly this tv is worth far more than the 1.3k I paid for the 55inch. When it came out it was high high 2k range. It has that level of quality and personally I wouldn’t even look at the c3 or g3 unless these are sold out. In short out of 100 I’d give it 100/100 this isn’t a rounding 5/5 it’s truly perfect and I have no complaints. Get it trust me you won’t be disappointed in the product."

          "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023",
          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "NOTE: LG recently released a firmware update to the LG C2 that substantially reduces the ABL auto-dimming! This makes it much more competitive to the PG4*UQ and other OLEDs without opening the service menu to disable those features.\n\nI hear a lot of issues people have with using a TV as a monitor, especially this one, but I haven't had any such issues. After setting it up properly, the only problem is the RWBG subpixel layout and having to turn it on along with my computer. But as someone that grew up with CRT monitors, having to press an extra button in addition to the power button is not even the slightest bit inconvenient. The thing that really kills this as a monitor is the subpixel layout.\nRWBG adds noticeable fringing and bleed on text on OSes calibrated for RGB subpixels. Turning subpixel rendering compensation off makes it tolerable, but it's still much harder to read than on a normal monitor, and some games use it regardless of OS settings with no obvious way to adjust it. For visual content like movies and games it isn't noticeable at all, however.\nAs long as you aren't planning to read a whole bunch, or if you sit further back and make your text bigger so the subpixels don't mess with the text as much, there isn't a single issue with using this as a computer monitor.\n\nI originally purchased the PG42UQ and PG48UQ instead, and got 2 dead 42's and one 48 that only survived for a few weeks before it spontaneously died. I'd like to compare some points on the C2 vs PG4*UQ:\n- The box on the C2 is thicker, the Styrofoam completely protects the screen unlike on the PG4*UQ where there are tons of gaps, the Styrofoam on the corners is also much thicker preventing drops from affecting the corners like what happened to BOTH of my PG42UQs, and the accessories and feet are placed in sane location unlike the strange Styrofoam origami that was both the PG42UQ and PG48UQ.\n- On both, the panel quality is fantastic. But on the C2, you can really tweak the settings until everything is perfect, especially if you have the service remote or other way to get into the service menu. This TV in particular can easily be color calibrated to make it shine in whatever environment you put it in with 22 point white balance adjustment, gamma curves, and multiple black/white level boosts and compensations.\n- The glossy screen is a boon as it leaves the blacks completely dark, vs. a matte screen like on the PG4*UQ where there is significant light bleed and blooming.\n- The C2's panel is much thicker and doesn't feel fragile compared to the dangerously paper-thin, basically unprotected edges on the PG4*UQ\n- The power button housing on the bottom doesn't bend easily and feel like it's going to snap off like on the PG4*UQ. It's also much thinner and less obnoxious to look at. Man, I hate \"gamer\" stuff.\n- In general, the design on the C2 is much more sleek, simple, and modern, allowing it to fit into the room better than the eye-catching \"gamer\" aesthetic on the PG4*UQ.\n- Due to the thicker panel backplate and rear cover design, the C2 is easier to lift safely without feeling like you're going to damage it.\n- All the cable managing on the C2 is in one spot on one side only, instead of top, right, and bottom.\n- With the right settings in Game Optimizer mode, the C2 can reach the same point-for-point performance metrics as the PG4*UQ, with only the peak brightness not being as good (but that doesn't matter as it dips substantially for both the second a scene starts getting bright, after which the difference is negligible).\n- The subpixel layout on the PG4*UQ is better for reading text. This is the only praise I have for it over the C2.\n- The refresh rate can be overclocked on the PG4*UQ to a staggering 138Hz! Wow, how impressive. Unfortunately, the difference visually between 120Hz and 138Hz is basically nonexistent, as someone that has compared the C2 at 120Hz and PG48UQ at 138Hz. The response time is still fantastic on both units regardless of mode.\n\nOverall, highly recommend this as both a TV and a monitor. I don't use the smart features and leave it disconnected from the network, and unlike with other smart TV platforms, the C2 doesn't annoy you and simply lets you use it without the smart feature bloat impeding you. And if I want to consume content and use the motion smoothing etc. features, they're there at a press of the button. I don't think all the massive number of problems with the ASUS units make the overclocking or other small extra features worth it; and at the same time, the C2 offers some nice features of its own that the PG4*UQ doesn't have. I would highly recommend it as a multimon replacement as I am, if you're willing to live with the subpixel layout and having to turn the TV on and off separately to the connected PC; do note there is a Windows-only, community-maintained companion app, which I can't use as I don't use Windows."

          "review": "I recently purchased a TV from this seller on Amazon, and I must say that the experience has been nothing short of outstanding. From the moment I placed the order to the prompt delivery, everything went incredibly smoothly.\n\nFirst and foremost, the TV itself is a gem. The picture quality is absolutely breathtaking, with vibrant colors and crisp details that bring every scene to life. The sound quality is equally impressive, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience. I find myself completely immersed in my favorite movies and TV shows, thanks to this remarkable television.\n\nWhat truly sets this seller apart, though, is their exceptional customer service. Throughout the entire process, they were attentive, responsive, and went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction. They promptly answered all my pre-purchase questions, providing detailed information and expert advice to help me make an informed decision. Their dedication to customer satisfaction was evident from start to finish.\n\nFurthermore, the packaging was done with utmost care and attention to detail. The TV arrived in perfect condition, securely protected against any potential damage during transit. It was evident that the seller takes great pride in their products and values the customer's experience.\n\nI also appreciated the easy setup process. The instructions provided were clear and concise, allowing me to have the TV up and running in no time. It's always a pleasure when a product lives up to its promises, and this TV certainly exceeded my expectations.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase from this seller on Amazon. They have proven themselves to be reliable, trustworthy, and committed to delivering an exceptional customer experience. If you're in the market for a new TV, I highly recommend considering their offerings. I will undoubtedly turn to them for any future electronic needs. Kudos to the seller for their outstanding product and impeccable service!"

          "review": "Version: 77 inch\nSeller: Amazon\nDelivery by: NSD (more about this at the bottom)\nPhoto 1: 68\" width. Will need large tv stand to look \"right\".\nPhoto 2: Mid-day reflection handling.\nPhoto 3: Inputs are on the left side of the set. Thin screen, but a wider portion holds the internals.\n\nFirst, the product.\n\nThe picture is fantastic. Viewing high bit-rate content such as Blu-rays is amazing. Ultra HD (2160p) HDR content is flawless and Full HD (1080p) SDR content is handled well. I like the upscaling of my Nvidia Shield for 1080p-> 4K upscaling over the TV’s, but most individuals will find no issues. The ability to turn off pixels for true black allows for an amazing contrast of color and blacks.\n\nThis TV supports high frame rate video game consoles with up to 120 FPS and offers a variable refresh rate (VRR) for gaming that isn’t locked at a steady 120/60/30 FPS. VRR ensures that games that support it will appear smoother and free of the screen tearing that is normally associated with frame rates that don’t match the TV. For PS5 owners, this means games that support a 40 FPS mode can be fully enjoyed on this TV. For PC owners, your 60-120 FPS experience will be similar to a good monitor, plus the amazing features of a top-tier TV. Also, input latency while in game mode is untouchable by non-OLED displays.\n\nThe TV speakers sound fine for daytime TV programming, but I utilize the TV’s eARC feature to send audio to my sound system. This feature works fine and is only a menu toggle away. Unfortunately, I can’t speak on the audio performance beyond this.\n\nThe set handles reflections well, but that doesn’t mean they disappear. This brings me to my one issue with this set, which is an issue shared with most OLEDs. OLED does not get extremely bright. If you intend to use this set in a living room with many windows, I suggest black-out curtains for the best viewing. If you cannot control the light in your room, I recommend considering a high-end LED TV instead, as they can get much brighter than OLEDs.\n\nAs for the TV’s operating system, I find the remote’s “motion as a mouse pointer” a little annoying sometimes, but hardly worth docking stars. Very usable system. The TV handles streaming 4K content from YouTube, Disney, Plex, and other services without issue. The perk of a major brand is knowing popular apps will work without a problem. This remains the case with this set.\n\nLastly, I must discuss my delivery experience. A special freight delivery service is needed for a delivery item of this size. NSD handled fulfillment. My experience was abysmal.\n\nDelivery must be scheduled. A signature is required for delivery, and the item will be placed inside your door (allegedly). NSD was a no-call and no-show on the day of delivery, and they did not reach out to reschedule. I attempted to call NSD for rescheduling three times, was hung up on twice by their system while waiting, and the third time resulted in being told that the local office would call to reschedule. After three more days of no contact, I had to contact chat support another three times over three days, asking to be contacted to reschedule. The second chat said NSD would escalate my delivery due to a no-call no-show. The third chat let me know that had not been done but assured me that they would. The sixth time is the charm. Delivery tracking showed the TV in town for an entire week before delivery was “attempted” and another week before the company finally called to deliver (no rescheduling of delivery, just delivery with only a few minutes warning). I live on a military installation, and the delivery team said they were not able to come onto the installation. This can be the result of several things: a lie, laziness, criminal history of one or both delivery members, or drugs/weapons in the delivery vehicle. As the company did not call to reschedule, I was out of town when they called me for delivery. Fortunately, I had a coworker I trusted to accept delivery off-base and hold the TV at his home until I was able to return.\n\nAs the delivery was not fulfilled by Amazon and the product itself is great, I am not deducting from my rating for this experience. However, let this be a horror story of delivery for potential buyers of the 77” version. If you have to buy online because you are rural like me, select NSD as an absolute last resort. A $2,400 purchase can be quite stressful when no one wants to talk to you about its delivery."

          "review": "After lots of online research and in-store viewing I settled on a previous year model 77\" screen OLED, the LGC2-PUA (not for WalMart or Cosco) model. It has more features than I will regularly use and has the best features of the things I want. The newer G2 isn't really a better product if you can get this model.\n\nI settled on this early for picture quality, but hesitated because other reviews noted the interface as difficult or annoying. Then, I discovered some online videos showing hidden menu features to simplify the display and eliminate those same annoyances that others complained about, but apparently missed the tips on. The menu does SOME self-explaining, but you will need to read about the effects if you want to go mess with a DIY calibration for your room. Default isn't too bad, but there are lots of tweaks you can use to get the best in your home.\n\nI have 81 near-flawless hours on the set after gaining operating tips online for tweaking settings. It displays well even in moderately bright day, as long as direct sun isn't hitting the screen, Evening viewing is quite stunning allowing a change of settings for more depth and color. The screen can be very reflective of lamps and other light sources, but we have overhead lighting so don't have an issue there. Off-axis viewing is decent especially in the vertical as we can watch from the upstairs internal balcony. The unit has a self-cleaning feature at shutdown that refreshes pixels every few hours so that burn-in isn't likely.\n\nSet-up was quick and we followed basic LG advice for unpacking. The stand went on easily but does require two people; one to to position & hold the screen until the through-screws can anchor the pedestal to the set. A/V connectors are placed on the side and easily accessible. Premium-capacity HDMI WILL BE a necessary expense to preserve best quality, but there are many reasonably-priced options.\n\nWe route sound to wired, external speakers with a Denon AVR but the TV sound is not too bad with the AI tweaks built-in, and would work OK in a small room setting.\n\nIt WAS more than I intended to spend (after the existing 2014 65\" plasma died) but has been well-worth the money in quality and performance."

          "rating": "4.0",
          "review": "This really is the best picture quality in the biz. Anything better is only by a small margin in very technical ways that very few users will notice, or need very specific types of scenes in order to display their upper hand. I have a few Samsung QLED displays of varying quality and this blows them away (although Neo QLEDs are closer in match, still not that close). I was sick of inconsistent blacks, backlighting blooming, and other typical LED issues and this TV does not have any of those issues. But I left a little wanting on the software. Here's the breakdown.\n\nPicture Quality 5/5:\nIt's simply the best. Viewing angles are great, contrast is great, HDR and Dolby Vision content is looks spectacular, backlighting is perfect. I had issues with all of these items on my Samsung QLEDs - the blacks and backlighting just completely drove me nuts with those, especially in dark scenes. Practically no viewing angle on a QLED, this you can look at it from 178 degrees with no color degradation. New OLEDs are pretty bright - I live near Phoenix AZ so it's bright everyday, and this is in a North facing living room with big windows. I leave my blinds open all day in there and there are no issues with brightness. So don't listen to people who say it's not bright enough, unless maybe you plan on using this outside in the sun. I will say that the front is more of a reflective glossy surface, so keep in mind lights behind you that may reflect on the tv. I also thought I damaged the panel mounting it to the wall because there were a lot of vertical lines when I turned it on, especially on the left, but after running the Pixel Cleaning cycle on the OLED Panel Care menu the lines completely went away so that's kinda cool.\n\nSoftware 4/5:\nI do like the software on Samsung better. This isn't BAD per-say... it just isn't great. Menus are as clean and easy as the Samsung home screen, or the mini menu that pops over the current content (I don't think LG even has that, just goes to the main home screen). I have a Samsung frame, and that gallery software blows the LG gallery software out of the water. Also not sure you can really compare because a true gallery option isn't really an option due to OLED burn in - you really don't want it displaying one image all day. Alexa kinda doesn't work as well as my Samsung as well. However, I do like that it shows as always on so that I can beam some Airplay content from my phone while the tv is off and it just turns on and goes to my selection.\n\nRemote 4/5:\nEh it's fine. I like the pointer feature, it's better than a wii remote, but if you accidentally scroll the center button instead of click when not using the pointer it switches to pointer and that's annoying. It's also huge! Well, by modern standards. Apple TV remotes are small and maybe too sparse on buttons, but I like the new Samsung remotes that are slim and have the solar charger on the back. They are also bluetooth so you don't need an IR line-of-sight to work. There are a ton of unnecessary buttons on the LG remote. They need to sexy it up and simplify the button layout and switch to BT instead of IR and that would get them back into the modern day remote.\n\nSound 3/5:\nIt's fine - all modern tvs are bad cause they are so slim but this is actually ok. I use their S90QY soundbar/subwoofer so not an issue for me (separate review for that). But why would you buy this tv and go for sub-par sound? Go treat yourself to a nice hometheater, you won't regret the addition.\n\nAesthetics 5/5:\nIt's pretty sexy. People who come over always comment on how thin it is. I have it mounted to the wall with a 0.6\" thick wall mount so that's about as close to the wall as you can get. The bezels are smaller than any other display I've seen. The stand it comes with is unnecessarily big and bulky in my opinion but yeah it looks better on the wall anyways. It's definitely a statement piece in the living room.\n\nDolby Atmos/Dolby Vision 5/5:\nWhenever I stream content that supports this format, it shows a little popover in the top right for a few seconds telling me that it's using that format and my soundbar switches to the right audio profile setting over the e-Arc connection, and the content looks and sounds perfect. Feels like I have the best home theater around. You have to try hard to find it's flaws. Best viewing experience I have ever had.\n\nSummary:\nBest in class viewing experience for the money. They could improve the software and remote a bit, but they aren't unusable and just take a bit of adjusting. Definitely need a good Dolby Atmos capable sound system to really maximize the experience. LG may have finally gotten me off Samsung displays, but now Samsung is hot on their heels with new OLED panels coming out. In 2023, I'd say buy LG C2 OLED (C3 only has marginal improvements for a higher price). We'll see who comes out on top in 2024."

          "review": "This TV is the absolute best I have ever owned, no question. It performs very well in dimly lit and brightly lit rooms. The picture is phenomenal, and I absolutely love the myriad of settings to fine-tune everything exactly how I want.\n\nI game pretty extensively, and my experience of this TV with my Playstation 5 has been excellent! It makes for a great gaming experience, can handle everything that the PS5 is capable of, and I simply love the 'game mode' that the TV has, complete with being able to select the type of game I am playing and it automatically adjusts several settings to match the game.\n\nA big plus for me is the screen burn prevention technology that this TV comes with. The ever so slight dimming of static displays on the screen (a HUD in virtually every game I play), and minor, periodic repositioning of those static images to help prevent screen burn are great! You legitimately don't even notice either feature unless you are really paying attention to it, but it does enough that I have yet to have a single issue with screen burn in the last nearly 4 months of heavy gaming. The TV looks just as good right now as it did when it first came out of the box.\n\nMy ONLY knock on this TV, and it is a relatively minor issue, is that is occasionally thinks I'm talking to it to issue a command when I'm simply gaming with friends. Can be a minor distraction when the prompt comes up on the screen, but it's not a major issue. I ensured that I have the setting off that would allow for hands-free Alexa control, instead opting for it to function under the push-and-hold of the Alexa button on the remote, but somehow that doesn't seem to stop the TV from infrequently trying to operate hands-free regardless. Again, not a huge issue, just a minor annoyance. Everything else that this TV offers far outweighs such a minor thing, so my rating remains at 5 stars.\n\nSimply put, if you want a fantastic OLED TV that definitely delivers on what it promises, the C2 is the way to go. I see that the C3 is about to launch, but the 65\" C2 at under $1700 is perfect for me. I don't have any desire to pay $2500 for the 65\" C3 for what is very likely a minor upgrade, if any at all. I'd have to imagine the C3 might have some software and/or UI changes that may somehow improve general quality-of-life, but I find it very unlikely that the screen quality and image quality of the C3 will be any different. Short of being an 8K resolution, there's nothing I can see where it could be improved. (8K is absolutely useless right now anyway; essentially no media content is in 8K).\n\nPerfect TV without draining your savings account! I may end up buying a second one for my bedroom, in all honesty. It's that good."

          "review": "For me, a TV is 50/50 picture/convenience. This is a zero on convenience. (Update 3/19/23 I'll Never buy an LG tv again).\n\nForget the nonsense about \"oleds don't get that bright\". People are just saying stuff that they hear the pros saying because it's a couple hundred nits lower than an LED set. It's plenty bright for HDR highlights and daytime viewing. I have to squint my eyes. And if you're like most people who work a 9-5 and mostly watch tv in the evenings - you'll find it bright enough. Come on people.\n\nLet's start with the UGLY:\n\nCEC: NIGHTMARE\nI have a PS5, XBSX, Shield Pro. Whether these devices are all plugged into tv then ARC-> Yamaha receiver, -OR- everything plugged into a new Denon 760H receiver then eARC-> tv, it's equally faulty. The tv likes to turn on my PS5 whenever I hit the input button (it shows the row of inputs first like it should, but then turns on and switches to PS5, also whenever I hit the back button from the ThinQ menu (I need to remember to hit the HOME button instead) and other odd buttons it fires up the PS5. Last night it did this when I hit the settings button ?!? Cannot get the Shield Pro to turn the tv on when it powers on. Yet, it will turn the tv on when it's connected to my 10 year old Yamaha receiver (eARC to tv).\nThe Universal Control Management is terrible. So much bloated crap on this TV.\n\nAuto-resume?!? Pause while watching netflix. 3 minutes later it starts playing. Watching something on plex- exit to home screen. 5 min later it switches to Plex and resumes movie.\n\nALEXA: HORRIBLE\nThis has to be the WORST Alexa integration EVER. My 3 year old Sony 900h connected on day one and has been FLAWLESS. Same with my $400 TCL roku tv. I say \"Alexa, turn off xxx tv\" and it would work 100% of the time. NOT ON THIS TV. It took me a week to troubleshoot, uninstalling apps, reinstalling (why are there 2 different LG devices on the Alexa app?!?). I'd say it works 10% of the time. Usually it says \"LG tv is not responding, please check it's network and power connection). If I grab the LG remote and hit the Alexa button and tell it to turn off it will work. But I could obviously just hit the power button on the remote.\n\nUPDATE: try calling the Tv \"tv\" instead of \"lg tv\" . ALSO-\" the tv has its own Alexa built in. Our echo dots are all named \"echo\" so this actually works quite well. Try calling \"alexa\" to the tv and issuing command. This has been working lately rather than telling my dot \"echo, pause the tv\". We'll see tomorrow. /update. (This still only works 50% of the time. Usually says \" network error\". 3/19/23)\n\nLEARNING CURVE: STEEP AF\nMake sure to register at AVSFORUM and read up/post your questions. The menu settings are very confusing and oddly placed. Read the manual, do your research. Go onto RTINGS.\n\nREMOTE: LOVE/HATE\nThe pointer wheel is kind of cool and probably quicker most of the time. It's like using a Wii remote but far more accurate and stable. The problem is when you just want to click over and select something (by pressing the wheel in). But my finger slips and instead of pressing the wheel in it turns the wheel which brings up the pointer and takes much longer to do what I need to do. There's also no Play/Pause button, you need to press in the wheel.\n\nI consider myself a person of average intelligence but it's 2023 All remotes should have 3 things MANDATORY:\n1. ALL buttons need to light up when lifted (like the Shield remote).\n2. There ABSOLUTELY NEEDS to be a sliding LOCK BUTTON to prevent accidental button press (and kid mischief).\n3. It needs to have a remote finder. Go into the app, hit a button, the remote makes a sound.\n(4). It would be nice to have a few learning buttons and customizable app buttons, not just Netflix.\n\n\"Gallery\" feature is a missed opportunity. It only appears if you are on an external input after the device has been powered off. Or you can select the gallery app manually. Here's a stellar idea - why not use the gallery as the screensaver instead of the ugly fireworks or clock?\n\nGAMING: SUPERB\nPlaying Horizon Forbidden West on PS5 at 60+ FPS in 4K is absolutely ASSAULTING on the eyes. It looks incredible! TV is responsive in regards to input lag and response time. When the tv is in GAME MODE, hitting the options button on the TV brings up the GAME menu which shows you all the gaming-related options and displays the current FPS on screen. Very nice.\n\nMOVIES: OBJECTIVE\nNo TV is perfect. Side viewing angle is big for me. I can see the color washout sitting 12\" over on the couch while watching my Sony 900h LCD tv. Unacceptable. This TV has an AWESOME VIEWING ANGLE. Go to RTINGS to view and compare. There is no discernable color/luminance washout in any seat in my living room. You need to go off to the extreme right/left to notice it.\n\nMy dvd backups played via PLEX app on TV look incredible, thanks to the rich OLED blacks. 1080p BD rips also look fantastic (compared to my LCD SONY 900h). And of course 4k content looks great. We all know about the \"inky\" blacks of OLED, no need to talk about it. Image quality is the best I've seen.\n\nSTUTTER/(Judder?):\nThis is a big one for me. During panning shots, usually when there is something tall and thin not moving on the screen there is a HORRIBLE STUTTER effect. It's jaggy and looks like the picture can't keep up. It's extremely jarring and takes me right out of the experience. This is due to the extremely fast response time of OLED technology. I find it extremely undesirable and a flaw. Options to mitigate this will introduce the Soap Opera effect, which is worse IMO.\n\nSOUND OUTPUT\nSound on the tv is fine. The usual. Sound output via ARC/eARC will only output the basics: stereo, Atmos, Dolby Digital and (DD+) to your receiver. And there is a difference between this DD and the DD you will find on a DVD/Blu Ray. It's a much more boring, stripped-down version (as with the Atmos I have heard) It's a lower bitrate signal. But it will suffice if you're going for a true 1-remote system. The TV will NOT OUTPUT DTS, DTS-MA, DD True HD via ARC/eARC. ***UPDATE: RECENT NEWS INFORMED THAT LG MIGHT START OFFERING DTS OUTPUT VIA ARC. IT'S UNSURE WHETHER THIS TV WILL RECEIVE THIS UPDATE*** Go onto RTINGS to check this info. Most TV's these days do not support outputting hi res audio signals which is unfortunate. The Nvidia Shield Pro is the recommended set-top box if hi-res audio is important to you.\n\nwebOS: fine\nEveryone seems to hate on the webOS. Look, they ALL have ads. I much prefer the Google Android (SONY tv, Shield) OS. But this one is fine. It offers all the apps I need: Netflix HBO MAX, Hulu, Disney +, and all the other ones, and displays them in a row at the bottom of the screen. You can easily go to what you want without looking or noticing all the other ads and crap on the tv. There is also another \"ThinQ\" app home screen where you can look at more crap you will probably never use. I stay away from all of this and hit my buttons very precisely otherwise one wrong move and I will launch the PS5 or some other device via CEC.\n\nHINT: If your PS5 (maybe other devices too) does turn on, hit the (...) button on the LG remote to bring up a menu where you can put the PS5 back into sleep mode.\n\nEYES\nIt took about 6 weeks for my eyes to adjust to this tv. Not sure of it was the detail, the brightness (it's plenty bright for me) or the blue light - whatever - my eyes got strained. It felt like a dull pressure behind my eyeballs. I'm 43 and perhaps I have some eye issues, so this is objective. I'm sort of used to it now, however I do start to feel eye strain in excess of 2/3 hours. Sooner if gaming.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: WOULD I BUY THIS TV AGAIN?\nI don't think so, especially now with other brands (SONY) offering OLED. I just don't think I should have so much to complain about with a $2500 tv. I would expect it with HiSense, TCL, Westinghouse basement bargain garage sale tvs, but not with a top shelf LG OLED.\n\nI would NOT choose OLED if there was another tech that offered similar gaming response time, decent black levels, and NO STUTTER during panning shots. This is like right on the edge of being a deal-breaker for me.\n\n1/30/23 - I will update when/if things change. 3/19/23. I still hate this tv. Love the picture quality but just HATE the way it operates and all the shortcomings. No more LG for me."

          "review": "Yes, I didn't give this a great rating because the engineers made way too many amateurish mistakes in the user interface. To show why is a long review ...\n\nThis TV lacks ATSC 3.0. In the end, I didn't care much because when I downloaded the manual of a very popular competitor's TV that \"had\" ATSC 3.0, the manual stated it wouldn't decode the high def content! Wow--not very useful. So, I wondered how many other TVs had the same limitation that \"claimed\" ATSC 3.0 which is why I removed that as a requirement.\n\nI personally feel that we are approaching the point of diminishing returns on how good TV displays look. Case in point, I looked at the TVs at Walmart & Target, which cost 1/3 this one and they don't look bad. Yes, you can see some color shifting at extreme angles, but still, not bad. As for more expensive TVs, I looked at the various reviews out there and my take is that you can measure differences in display quality amongst the ones costing more or less the same, but unless the TVs are sitting side by side, I think the display difference is barely perceptible, if at all (some reviews actually mention this). In the end, I decided to focus on the user interface of the TVs, not rely on reviewer's measurements.\n\nBefore I go into the remote and user interaction I want to discuss the poor upconversion when watching 480i TV. The jaggies are readily apparent and so bad, small text is difficult to read. It's like all they did was double the pixels and did little interpolation. I attempted to take some pictures. One is from live TV and the other is the same program recorded (and interpolated) by my HTPC. My HTPC with 10 year old software and processor uses a very basic linear interpolation algorithm and it outperforms this TV when displaying this content.\n\nOne thing I noticed when looking at the various TVs was some remotes didn't have numbers. Wow. I'm a TV watcher. I couldn't imagine scrolling through channels trying to get to the one I want.\n\nThe remote is an RF one, but the TV does support an IR one (you lose the \"mouse like cursor\" and I think the \"mouse wheel\" though). The first thing you notice is the buttons are kind of small and close together. I have small hands, so I didn't care.\n\nThe layout is bad. They didn't even try. No excuse--they've been making remotes for how many decades?? The volume up/down paddle is on the left. Below it is the home button, NOT the mute button (the mute button is in the center, where the home button should be). The \"go back to previous channel\" button is on the left, not on the right where the channel up/down paddle is. What this means is you'll be looking at your remote a lot.\n\nThen you notice the various input selection \"types\": up/down \"paddles\" for volume and channels; a ring that can be pressed up/down and maybe left/right; a mouse-like wheel; and don't forget the \"mouse cursor\". Why all of them? It's like rather than do a quality exercise by having various people interact with it and give feedback so they could select one or two, they just used all of them. One problem is all the real estate wasted by this. The other issue is, and this is really weird: the different buttons only work in certain situations. For example, when you start typing a channel number, a list pops up with the channels it could be. You can use the ring to move the selection up/down, but NOT the mouse wheel--apparently, it's function is (apparently only) to scroll to the next channel you are currently watching--it won't work to move the selection up/down. And you can't use the mouse cursor either. It's darn right amateurish, by engineering standards. Think about using a PC/Mac app and in one spot, you had to use the up/down arrows; in another spot you use the mouse, in yet another, you used the mouse wheel. It's maddening and makes it hard to use.\n\nThe \"go back\" ONLY deals with TV channels. It should go back to what was previously displayed on the TV. For example, if you were watching HDMI input 3 and jumped to TV channel 3.2, pressing the \"go back\" button should take you back to HDMI input 3. This is nice because it's a hack to act as a screensaver if you pause the video on an HDMI input. This display suffers from image retention, so if you get up to make popcorn, for example, you don't want a still image. Since there's no \"screen saver\" button (hint), this hack works nicely to quickly jump back and forth. My old Panasonic TV did this and I used it all the time.\n\nThe cursor is nice (and it's fun to use). The mouse wheel works pretty well. I think they found the sweet spot for how hard it is to turn and falsely turning it. However, the wheel is a selection button as well, and a couple of times when scrolling I inadvertently pushed too hard and selected something I didn't want. Also, when scrolling through the up/down submenu for channel selection, I have hit that wheel causing a channel change that I didn't want.\n\nThe remote has a bunch of largish \"quick jump\" buttons on the bottom for jumping to various streaming services. However, they take up valuable real estate. I'd rather they were smaller or replaced by a row of smaller buttons you could program to the stream of choice. There's some small colored buttons (have yet to determine their purpose) and maybe they would suffice.\n\nThe RF remote has a voice input. I was looking forward to trying it out, but it only works if the TV is connected to the internet.\n\nWhen you power up an external device connected to HDMI, a popup appears asking if you want to go to that HDMI input. Nice, BUT, if you try to use the mouse wheel, it unselects the default \"Yes\", but doesn't select the other option (\"No\"). You have to use the ring for that.\n\nOne last note about the RF remote. There are a lot of clones for sale here and elsewhere. Beware. Some hint they are RF remotes when they aren't. And every non LG RF one I looked at appeared to be lacking a sticker on the back with the FCC ID. To be legal for sale/use in the U.S., each device emitting RF must have an FCC ID (that you can lookup) to verify it passed FCC tests. This is to ensure the safety of you and your neighbors. Imagine someone attached to some medical equipment that is interfered with by an illegal RF remote.\n\nUPDATE: I've had this awhile now. I've noticed glitches every now and then. Sometimes it's slow reacting to user input. It lost track of time (was like 10 hours off). I had to uncheck \"auto\" and set it manually to correct it. Time will tell if it will keep track of daylight savings time for me. Lastly, I was looking at the OTA content guide (\"what's on each channel\"--part of ATSC meta data). I moved the remote too quick which causes the cursor to display and then all the channel data blanked out. I had to exit out and come back in to get it to display the content.\n\nTo be fair--there have been two or three updates now for this TV (yikes--why so many?!). Maybe they fixed some of the glitches I'm seeing. However, I'm not a big fan of updating--my experience says you risk breaking something.\n\nAnd the weird layout of the remote is still driving me nuts. I wish a 3rd party would make a remote for these TVs."

Be patient, it's quite involved, but you'll be rewarded with a most stunning picture."

          "review": "This is my second LG and third led flat screen. The screen here is incredibly thin (at least at the top) and the whole unit was much lighter than my previous 65 inch. That made it easy to mount by myself. The picture is beautiful and because I have shades on all the windows of my TV room the brightness is more than adequate (knew OLEDs can have a brightness problem but this model--and the next higher--have been reviewed as quite good in the brightness area.) Because I had an LG previously, I am quite familiar with the controls and the options although the OS in much updated from my previous unit, but that is part of why I bought new. Now I can do any and all streaming directly from the TV without needing to go through my cable service and/or a Fire cube as I was doing. It is also very convenient that the TV controls the on/off of the new AV receiver I also just bought (down to only two remotes!). The only difficulty I had in getting everything setup was to get the lip sync correct which ended up requiring that I bypass any corrections from both the TV and Receiver. Amazon delivery was very good and fast and the extra service one gets with a purchase at this level was greatly appreciated."

They replaced the screen, not a board.\n\nI reiterate that the TV itself is a 5 — it’s got a fantastic picture and I have 30+ years of broadcast TV production experience so I know what I’m talking about.\n\nBut I’m only updating my rating to 4/5 instead of 5/5 because of LG’s service process.\n\nWhen I opened the original repair ticket, LG automatically provided troubleshooting recommendations. I had already followed the instructions that are available online and told them so. However, there’s no ability to attach a picture to the ticket and they automatically close the original ticket and then ask you to open a new ticket with all of the same information that was provided previously in case troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.\n\nOnce the second ticket was entered LG eventually asked for a picture but then they didn’t make it available to the repair facility so they asked for a picture as well.\n\nStart to finish, time to repair completion was about a week and the TV was not completely down during this time. But I think LG’s repair ticket workflow needs some tweaks\n\nOriginal review:\nWould have rated this 5 stars as it's a fantastic TV but yesterday a thin line developed top to bottom about 1/3 of the way in from the right edge. Have contacted LG for repair and will update my review based on the repair experience."

The picture quality is stunning, the colors are rich and crisp, and the blacks are deep.\n\nAs far as webOS, there are worse operating systems! Messier than Apple and Roku, but better than Samsung. It’s easy to get to Netflix, Hulu, etc., easy to connect external devices. Initial setup is relatively simple, although I don’t like having to download yet another app (in this case the LG ThinQ app) in order to get started. There are a lot of settings menus and some of them have bizarre names that don’t really explain what the menu is for (e.g.“OLED Self-Care”), but overall I found it easy to navigate. I’m also a big fan of the Wii-style remote? Obviously it’s huge and clunky and has too many buttons, but the scroll wheel is cool and I use the point-and-click feature a ton more than I expected to.\n\nBasically, a great TV at a great price point. Can’t believe I got this for under 1k."

Of course you get stunning contrast, colors, and crisp 4K scenes, but I want to call out some lesser mentioned features that I’ve already come to love.\n\n- Magic remote: the Nintendo WII style cursor that allows you to navigate all apps either through traditional remote buttons or via the aim and click method is great - providing a new way of doing things but allowing you to still use traditional buttons. Also allows for equipment control to control my Samsung sound bar.\n- WebOS: unlike my older LG tv, now all my streaming apps are native to tv. I get to ditch the Fire tv cube for paramount plus and HBO max\n- Alexa integration works nicely\n- Game mode, presets like FPS, RPG etc make switching for each game super easy. Already this tv has given an upper edge in FPS games.\n- Sound- for some reason all sound is crisper\n- Airplay: iOS screen mirroring and airplay work great, as well as screen mirroring from my MacBook Pro. I didn’t realize this was a feature.\n\nOnly downside so far is the Picture in Picture / split screen not working (seen other reviewers having same experience). It would be great to be able to play a game and have Netflix in a PIP window. Hopefully future software updates will fix this."

This made the movie even more immersive and suspenseful. The colors on the B2 are also incredibly vibrant and accurate. The B2 is also packed with smart features; overall, we are incredibly happy with the LG B2 OLED TV. It is a significant upgrade from our previous TV and provides an amazing home theater experience."

With 8 million self-lit OLED pixels, this TV delivers a vivid viewing experience with infinite contrast, deep blacks, and over a billion colors, making everything I watch come to life in a way I've never seen before.\n\nThe α7 Gen5 AI Processor 4K is engineered especially for LG, and the algorithmically adapts and adjusts picture and sound quality for a lifelike viewing experience with depth and rich color. Additionally, the impressive 120Hz refresh rate keeps up with the fast movement in sports, video games, and movies for a sharp picture with smooth motion from start to finish.\n\nOne of my favorite features of this TV is the LG Game Optimizer mode, which includes NVIDIA G-SYNC, FreeSync Premium, and Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) to improve your gaming experience with fluid on-screen motion. Game Optimizer manages your game settings all in one place, making it easy to customize the TV for the best gaming experience.\n\nThe built-in access to Netflix, Prime Video, Apple TV app, Disney+, HBO Max, and over 300+ free LG Channels provides instant access to a vast selection of shows and movies. The TV also includes a Magic Remote, remote control batteries (AA), power cable, and quick start guide.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the LG B2 Series 65-Inch Class OLED Smart TV OLED65B2PUA to anyone who wants a top-of-the-line TV with advanced features, stunning picture quality, and seamless connectivity. It's worth every penny, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Five stars all around!"

Of course the Oled picture looks fantastic compared to an led tv, but my favorite feature is the AI upscaling. Dvd’s look better and have much less artifacting than any previous 4k tv I have owned. The AI upscaling on most blu rays however is so good that it almost makes them look native 4k. The picture is richer and cleaner looking that I have started ordering blu rays instead of 4k UHD disc when the price difference is significant because of how good blu rays now look! And 4k UHD looks so good on this its almost obscene to me.\n\nThere is screen glare if a light source is poorly placed in relation to the tv and the picture could be a bit brighter, but if your looking to own a fantastic tv and pay less than $1000 this tv is amazing. The image looks so good you will probably want a decent sound bar or speakers for the most immersive experience, but the tv sound is decent but lacking bass.\n\nI would never own another tv without AI upscaling. If you have more money buy an even better Oled tv otherwise I think at this time this is the most amazing sub $1000 experience at the time of writing this! FYI I paid $850 for this tv on Black Friday.\n\nLastly I got free unpack from Amazon. They screwed in the stand and put it on my entertainment center and confirmed it worked. They were nice and respectful and made it so I didn’t need a second person to set it up."

I’ve watched only black and white movies, color movies made in the 50s and 60s, modern 4k movies, and just standard 1080p movies and everything just looks gorgeous! You can see the details very clear. Blacks are BLACK and not just a muddied gray. There’s ZERO blooming. Watching Outlander is a pure treat. Yellowstone is amazing!\nI am gaming on this with a pc and my EVGA 3080 has no issues playing games like the new Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy on ultra everything. The colors of the games look superb.\n\nMy wife can back all of this up. She was a huge skeptic and didn’t understand why i wanted us to upgrade to this tv. She didn’t understand that is until we watched our first movie on it and she was completely blown away. I don’t think we can ever leave the OLED experience now.\n\nI looked at other tvs before buying this product. I looked at Samsung’s QLED tvs and LGs QNED tvs and none of them compare to this. I don’t know what’s the difference in picture quality between the LG C2 line and the B2 lines other than price but I’m telling you for the price i paid here at Amazon I love my B2.\nNow I’ve only used the tv for a couple of weeks as this was a Christmas purchase. So far I love everything about the tv and what it can do. Even the sound from the tv is good. I’ll update this if anything changes but for now I’m super happy with this purchase.\n\nUpdate: it’s Super Bowl weekend and this TV is on sale. Grab it. I still love my LG B2 and nothing I said before this update has changed. It’s going to be great watching the Eagles and Chiefs go at it for the big prize."

          "review": "This is my first experience with OLED, and it still shocks me sometimes how lifelike it is. Motion is so fluid and blacks are perfect, even when surrounded by light colors. My previous screen had a dense LED backlight array and it still can not compare. Watching it in a dark room is ideal, but it still looks good in normal room lighting. If needed, the picture can be calibrated for a brightly lit environment.\n\nIn terms of build quality, it is good so far. The top part is just a thin piece of glass, which is really cool to see with the perfect viewing angles, but the bottom is chunkier. The stand does look a bit cheap. For most people that are wall mounting, know that the mounting part is on the bottom. If you are replacing a traditional TV, this one will likely sit too high and the wall mount will have to be moved down. We had to figure that out.\n\nThis is our first LG TV, so it was another operating system to learn. The WiFi signal is strong and it has the standard apps. For whatever reason, we had to delete the Disney+ app and reinstall it before a show would start streaming properly. If you find the motion controls annoying, they can be bypassed by using the arrow keys and scroll wheel. Overall, a bit clunky, but navigation is fast.\n\nIn terms of picture quality modes, they are pretty interesting. Similar to the Nintendo Switch OLED, there are times when vivid settings that would be garish on a normal screen are ideal. They can \"fix\" shows that look overly dark on any screen and actually do a great job. HDR content looks startlingly lifelike, showing detail that was completely missing on our LED array TV. One area the software is pretty bad at is motion interpolation. If you decide to use it, it often leaves artifact trails behind moving objects on solid backgrounds. I've seen much better, and it is a feature perfectly suited to OLED.\n\nOverall, an incredible television that has spoiled me. I highly recommend it, even if there is room for improvement."

The blacks are so black, the colors pop, the viewing angle is very wide, and the anti glare coating is great. The automatic switch to Filmmaker Mode is great for movies. Streaming services with 4K are a must to get the best picture quality and look absolutely stunning. I added a LG soundbar with subwoofer that seamlessly operates with the TV remote. The standard TV speakers are decent, but the soundbar is a must for a movie theater experience. I purchased when the TV was on sale for $1996 and that is a bargain for the quality of TV. OLED is totally the way to go for movie night."

Cost 500 to 600.The two are the same brand not LG. For years apart. I learned the upgrades were price not years apart. Spend the money if you want greatness, I love everything about this tv. I got my LGB2 for a grand. The other TVs I have been like toys not masterpieces. The C2 would not have been more than a one-step upgrade. The C3 adds another step higher in improvement. Now If I were buying the 24 or 25 C4 or C5; that might make me jump in with $1500.00 on black Friday. The prices drop this year were not like last year on TVs. I spent twice the money and I got twice the tv."

          "review": "We have owned this TV for 3 weeks now. The 4K picture is excellent as is the picture from HD sources. Bright scenes and darker scenes are handled equally well on this LG OLED. A darker scene from a recent movie is attached.\n\nIf you watch a lot of old black and white shows, the SD picture is just okay - nowhere near as good as on our 13-year-old Panasonic plasma.\n\nThe sound from the speakers is very good. It even has a little bit of bass to it.\n\nThe screen on this TV is extremely thin. Installing the base and moving the TV to the TV stand had me a little concerned. My assistant, aka my wife, was sweating bullets, worried that she might damage it helping me move it to the TV stand. I think this TV is not quite as fragile as its thin screen leads you to believe and we had no problems.\n\nThe control is different from anything I've ever used. The selection arrow flies around on the screen as you wave the remote, and you select by pushing on the scroll wheel. I don't think that is very intuitive. There are a HUGE number of options for customizing your picture and sound within the menu.\n\nI am experiencing one anomaly. Sometimes when powering on this TV, the screen is covered in colorful vertical stripes. I have attached a photo of that. Changing to a different input immediately corrects the problem. It could be related to the current version of the LG firmware for this model. Time (and a later software update) will tell. I am hoping this isn't a sign of a problem developing. I took off one rating star for this issue.\n\nI do not use the TV's built-in apps so I can't speak to how well those work. I have a 4K Roku that I use to watch those services. The Roku works fine for me and the services are already set up.\n\nAll in all, this LG OLED has a great picture and sound. Time will tell as to its reliability. Our Panny plasma is still going strong after 13 years. I hope this LG lasts that long!"

When I received the new not refurbished TV the optical port was not connected right so the sound was bad, I called LG and they said this not covered under the warranty which makes no sense since it is a brand new TV. Amazon gave me a credit so I could get it fixed even though it wasn't their fault. So I took it to an LG licensed repair shop where I was told the main board needed replacing for $509 as it was defective. I called LG again and they still won't authorize getting it fixed, they said send it back to Amazon. Through frustration with LG wiping their hands of the problem I called Amazon and they took the TV even though they didn't have to.\n\nDo not buy a LG product if you are smart."

I am an avid Amazon shopper and I almost never write reviews but I live on my TV, between computer work, gaming, YouTube, Shopping, Pinterest, and movies I have my TV on a lot. Unfortunately my last TV was an OLED, great fluid picture with amazing blacks but after three years of gaming the burn in made it unwatchable. This TV is awesome I can say with confidence the picture is better than my OLED, I believe it is because of the upgraded processor and 8K capable hardware.\n\nPros: Amazing contrast, good OS, picture settings hold for all modes and inputs, Works great in my bright window full room, very few adjustments needed out of box, and GAMING IS UNREAL !!!!\n\nCons: OS could be snappier, AI sound and picture as well as motion blur and energy saver need to be turned off immediately before trying to set color and brightness. Had to plug it into its own outlet was getting some interference from other device power draws.\n\nConclusion: This TV is a buy Hope you enjoy yours as much as I am enjoying mine."

Not that big of a leap comparing1080P vs 1080P with my LW9800 that it replaced.\n- Preferred the EU stand, of which I thought what I was getting with this TV, but nope, took lots of table space. Slimline mount only applicable for TV 75+.\n- Uneven Halo Effect that can be seen with mouse cursor. Some area of the panel shows perfect cursor like an OLED panel, but not on others.\n- Like some others mentioned with CC.\n- It supports 6Ghz band wifi, but pretty much useless. Rep can't help, and just said choose different band, because as long as this TV can get internet speed of up to 25MBps... Then you are good to go! 25MBps is what needed to operate its smart TV function. At least my TV can only do a quarter of what my ISP provides. This TV gets 85MBps on 2.4 and 5 Ghz, while only getting 10MBps on its 6Ghz band. Grrrrrreeeattt. Basically don't put much expectations. It's there for look but don't touch . (YMMV)\n- Too many intrusive ADs, for its Smart TV function."

However, you could try and slide it upstairs and then disassemble in your room of choice.\n\nAs for the tv performance, it always seems to impress me with various bright colors.\n\nIt also appears like an OLED for its deep black color that matches the top and bottom bars.\n\nThe TV is compatible with Dolby Vision (e.g. many on Netflix) and HDR modes (e.g. The Tomorrow War on Amazon Prime)\n\nSound from the TV is impressive and should be coupled with additional speakers for a truly theater like experience.\n\nThis TV enables you to use Bluetooth speakers which is cool.\n\nWI-FI connectivity is amazing. No issues.\n\nCons: as some mentioned, I noticed issues with the closed captions.\nSometimes, I opt to turn the CC off.\n\nUpdate on January 1st, 2023:\n\nSo yesterday my wife and I were watching a movie. And I figured out how to solve the closed caption dimming issue. You need to set the Auto Dynamic Contrast to either Medium or High, which I think is best. It can be found under Advanced Settings under Brightness.\n\nUpdate on January 18th, 2023:\n\nAND also increase the contrast of the TV to 100%. This step and the one I provided on 1/1/23 will greatly reduce the dimming issue with the closed captions.\n\nAlso, make sure you use these settings for all APPS used with this TV."

          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "Prior to this, I had a basic 65\" LG 4K Smart TV from 2018 that I'd originally thought was the greatest thing I'd ever seen. And it was beautiful and clear, but of course the blacks were never actually black because the light was always on and bleeding through. Last year, the wifi entirely failed and even the ethernet connection started acting funky this year. Some of the apps started getting laggy and didn't want to work at all on the older version/style of webOS on this TV (I couldn't even watch HBOMax on it, I always had to switch to my Xbox's app). Thus, I started thinking of upgrading and a big bonus from work gave me the ability to do so without worrying much about cost.\n\nI'm SO glad I got this TV.\n\nThe apps all work smoothly and there's no hiccups with wired or wireless internet. There are SO MANY customization options for picture and sound and you can set them separately for different inputs or apply it across all of them if you find a set up you like. I mean, you can change between modes, brightness settings, AI settings, clarity settings, white and black balances, and even into things like sharpness and noise reduction. Too many options for me to even remember. My main changes have been turning Energy Saving off, Auto Dynamic Contrast to High and LED Local Dimming to High.\n\nMy favorite things are (of course) the picture and the sound. The picture is GORGEOUS and the deep blacks are incredibly impressive. There've been times I've caught myself staring at the edges of the screen where a shadow or the black bar on the movie would seamlessly blend into the black bezel to the point where I genuinely couldn't see where the screen ended and the bezel began. It was the first thing I started texting my friend about after I set up the TV! And when the screen is black, it's BLACK. Not dark grey. Not bleeding in around the edges. Solid black.\n\nNow, because of how dimming zones work, there are cases where you might have something bright next to/inside something black, and you will see a bit of a halo around it. The size of this halo will depend upon your TV settings and how large/small the item is. I've attached some photos with examples. On the first, you can see a large halo around the big white box on the screen (which was visible in real life, but not even as drastic as it appeared on camera), but nothing around the magic mouse's cursor at the top of the screen, and the surrounding black screen that takes up most of the screen is still black. In the second, you can see where the darkness at the top of the screen all goes to solid black and the black bar totally disappears, while on the bottom you can still see it due to that edge of the picture being brighter.\n\nAnother picture-related thing that has really impressed me is how the screen captures reflective/shiny things like bits of metal or sequins or glass. I was watching a TV show where a character was constantly wearing clothes with chrome studs or holographic sequins, and the way they glittered and caught light was so REAL. In lower quality images, those kind of reflections will get crushed into just looking like a white spot, but no detail was lost in these reflections on this TV.\n\nAnd for those worried about angles, my couch is off to the side instead of directly in front of the TV and I've noticed no difference in the picture. Even right next to the side of the TV and staring straight across it, the image and colors never fade or look any different.\n\nThen for the sound part I mentioned, it also has a lot of customization options just like the picture and you get to choose between different sound modes and different outputs. Mine's currently on the AI Sound Pro mode and I have it set to output to Optical Out Device + TV Speaker. I had used my LG soundbar with my previous TV and carried it over to this one, and I'd never seen the option to use both before. I love it! It can sound a little strange if you don't balance the volumes correctly, but I've found keeping the soundbar volume 2 clicks higher than the TV speakers works really well. I find having the extra speakers give a lot of the sound effects a more nuanced sound. The deeper sounds really come through my soundbar/subwoofer, while the lighter ones come through the TV. There's this added feeling of sounds moving around without having a better sound set up, thanks to the extra set of speakers beyond my soundbar. Without the soundbar, the built in speakers are great for a TV. They're just not as \"deep.\"\n\nIf I had to nitpick and complain about something, it would probably only be the scroll wheel/select button the Magic Remote. It could be that I'm just not used to it yet (my previous LG TV did not come with a Magic Remote) or that my nails having grown out a bit at the moment are getting in the way, but it's not always the most comfortable to click. I often end up trying to press it and I'll press the ring around it at the same time. That or I'm trying to press it to select something and the wheel scrolls and switches to cursor mode instead. I would've preferred the scrolling and selecting being two separate buttons, but honestly it's not a deal breaker and it doesn't behave weirdly often enough that I want to replace it with something else. It's actually a really cool innovation to be able to scroll or use it like a mouse on your TV!\n\nAll in all, I really love the TV and I'm incredibly impressed (if you couldn't already tell from the lengthy review). If you want to upgrade and you want to upgrade like I did, then I highly recommend it!"

I am currently constructing a small build out for a in wall fireplace and a beef up area to put these mounts so I can have it flushed to the wall.

Some probably complained about this TV and returned it. Then when I bought a NEW TV, Amazon shipped this one to me. This clearly wasn't a new TV. Amazon didn't replace, but they refunded and did pick up damaged product. Then I Bought it from BestBuy. Was delivered NEW before the Damaged on was picked up from Amazon. BestBuy also offered 24 months 0% financing. BestBuy offered a price match, so I was refunded $300 due to the price drop after purchase. Just a honest comparison"

The second purchase was not because I wanted two, but because I came into the TV room one morning and the lower, right portion of the screen was cracked and half the picture was gone. How? Don't really know, but the general consensus is that my two dogs weighing in at about a hundred pounds each were 'horse-ing' around and made contact with the screen. So be it. The set is now installed about a foot and a half higher on the console cabinet. Hope that helps."

          "review": " So far amazed at this tv. Waiting on new head unit and height speakers to complete my upgrade to experience full atmos! I do want to share couple of issue’s I experienced though for the next person. When going from an old none 1080p display upgrade your hdmi’s to 8k@60hz 4k@120hz with 48 Gbps data transfer trust me it makes all the difference also neither my xbox series x or ps5 would let me turn on or use allm or vrr until i did a hard reset on either console and you need to disable the hdmi cec setting on tv and both consoles before doing a reset notice you wont loose your games but you will have to download and update apps and resign in to everything afterwards this finally did get both my xbox series x and ps5 to finally recognize that my new display now supported everything fyi if your like me and carried over your old psvr from ps4 gen to your ps5 your hdmi setup will have to be recongfiged as well it is 1080p not 4k not happy about that but it is what it is just plug it back in when you want it I quess. Once I did all that everything works as it should full specs now as intended 4k@120 hdr dolby vision hdr10 allm vrr hgid it’s nice now can’t wait to finish my audio side now with full dolby atmos and dtsx hope my reveiw helps you next gen upgraders cause I couldn’t find any answers on ytube that helped me it took 2 days of aggravation to get it sorted out. Now go play on! And order an automatic hdmi switch your gonna need it for the 2.1 hdmi’s to run all your new tech Fyi i ordered the llano hdmi 2.1 four in one out 8k auto switcher and 2 rca to hdmi converters to convert and old ps2 and wii system to hdmi just to maintain usability since hdmi hookups is all the inputs the new lg qned85 has good luck"

Aside from this one issue I find it to be perfection.\n\nMy YouTube purchased movie content will not play Above 480p! Utter ridiculousness!!!\n\nI've tried everything from contacting LG support to doing my own Google search. The Google search led me to many Reddit topics that claim the 2022 model has this YouTube bug in the firmware that no one seems to know how to fix.\n\nHowever, there are several workarounds but none of them include fixing the tv YouTube application itself. To get my desired maximum resolutions especially for my 4K content, I can go through my PS5. I expect it works with my Xbox as well although I have not tested it. I have heard other methods work like Smart View but I have not tested that either. So again, there are definite workarounds that aren't too much of a pain but it's still a huge disappointment that this issue has not been fixed yet."

          "review": "The picture quality is very good, and we're very happy with this.\n\nWe have many wireless-enabled devices in our household: laptops, tablets, phones, appliances, printers, roku devices, security cameras, and more. The TV seems unable to maintain its wireless network connectivity. On evenings where we watch a show, we have had to always re-connect our wireless network. Once we do so, the TV works just fine. No other device exhibits this behavior, including the roku device located right next to the TV. The TV has been updated to run the latest firmware, which has not helped the problem.\n\nWe have mixed views on the remote. On the one hand, the Wii-like pointer makes entering passwords a little faster, though you do have to get used to the sensitivity. It's impressive how it \"just works\", controlling the TV, sound bar, and Roku devices with no setup required. On the other hand, the layout of the buttons is not intuitive, and does not \"flow well\" with the TV menu. Compared to other remotes, the buttons are hard to find by feel in a dark room for movie nights where the lights might be low.\n\nIf the wireless problem mentioned above could be fixed, I would rate the TV at least one (if not two) stars higher."

Concerns about burn in and burn out led me in the QLED/QNED direction. My new LG QNED/Mini LED set has a beautiful picture. The picture is easily viewable from all seating angles in my living room. The picture is bright and clear. Blacks may not be as perfectly black as an OLED set but they are so black that I don't know if the difference would be noticeable unless the sets were side by side. The audio quality is an unexpected plus. I haven't had time to fish a fiber optic cable through the wall, so I have been using the built-in speakers. Not as much bass as I like but the audio quality is very good."

          "review": "I researched for months before deciding on a TV and not once did I do this in a store. Of all brands, It came down to this: Did I want a big \"name\" brand like Sony, Samsung or did I want more technology in the set itself to weatherproof myself against outdated technology in 2-4 yrs. I went with the later. Of all those choices of manufacturers, LG stands out as the most reliable choice with the least problems with awesome upgrades in features vs Sony, Samsung and for a better price.\nThe QNED line was our # 1 choice for screen techology and my best guess is QNED (similar to Samsung) will be the screen technology most popular going forward. Absolutely awesome picture in 4K Quantum Dot NanoCell Display from LG. Just read about QNED and you'll see why. OLED is too expe nsive and has reports of screen burn in, and a lower lifespan.\nSo in LG QNED, the choices were between this model 75QNED85UQA vs 75QNED80UQA and the 75QNED90UQA. 80 vs 85 vs 90? 80 is about $500 cheaper than 85 and 85 is less than the 90.\nAll have the same Wi-Fi standard (802.11ac) and the same connectivity -- HDMI-CDC simplelink (lets you use one remote to control all connected devices), and most important to us, the updated/latest HDMI 2.1 (4K @ 120Hz) on ports 3, 4 (4 total HDMI ports), plus HDCP 2.2 on all, plus HDMI ARC (is port 3), and an ethernet port, digital Audo Out (optical), and RF for Antenna/cable, and others. It does NOT have the older RCA composite or component connections for older devices but we purchased separately an RCA to HDMI converter for $11 for an older Wii.\nWe eliminated the 90 up front because it was 2021 modle with a older generation processor than either the 80 and 85, and it also had older WebOS Operating System, despite having full array diming pro backlight dimming technology and other features. Plus it was more expensive.\n\nSo between the 80 and 85, I chose the 85 because it has these features that the 80 doesn't.\nAudio: The 85 has Dolby Atmos The 80 doesn't\nBacklight type: Mini-LED vs Edge ****\nBacklight Dimming Technology: Precision in the 85 vs local in the 80\n100% Color Volume in the 85 not in the 80\nObject Brightness Booster in the 85 not in the 85\n******HDR: The 85 has Dolby Vision HDR (Cinema HDR Dolby Vision, HDR 10, HLG and Dynamic Tone Maping Pro. The 80 does NOT have Dolby Vision HDR or the pro version of tone maping *\n\nThe HDR was a key in choosing between the 80 and 85 but also the sound. It was worth the extra $$ to us as we plan to keep our TV for many years. Overall, the LG just outwitted, outsmarted and outplayed Sony and Samsung. Now set up, our 75QNED85UQA is unbelievably beautiful.\n\nOF course, we upgraded to HIGH END 8K HDMI cables to connect to our 4K Roku because those will transmit 4K @ 120Hz in HDMI ports 3, 4. Couldn't find a 4K cable that would do that but the 8K will. Also don't forget to upgrade your internet signal whomever it comes from -- and ifi you subscribe to Hulu, Netflix, etc . . . you'll need to upgrade your plans to the 4K plans or you're wasting your money on a 4K TV.\nWe've found that Netflix, so far, carries the most 4K movies and shows -- pages and pages full of them. And you can even see the fleas in the Bonobos beard in the National Geographic specials . . Absolutely awesome.\nLast, setup was a breeze. The TV is heavy -- the extra setup (paid for) was worth it. The TV is heavy."

          "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2022",
          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "Prior to this, I had a basic 65\" LG 4K Smart TV from 2018 that I'd originally thought was the greatest thing I'd ever seen. And it was beautiful and clear, but of course the blacks were never actually black because the light was always on and bleeding through. Last year, the wifi entirely failed and even the ethernet connection started acting funky this year. Some of the apps started getting laggy and didn't want to work at all on the older version/style of webOS on this TV (I couldn't even watch HBOMax on it, I always had to switch to my Xbox's app). Thus, I started thinking of upgrading and a big bonus from work gave me the ability to do so without worrying much about cost.\n\nI'm SO glad I got this TV.\n\nThe apps all work smoothly and there's no hiccups with wired or wireless internet. There are SO MANY customization options for picture and sound and you can set them separately for different inputs or apply it across all of them if you find a set up you like. I mean, you can change between modes, brightness settings, AI settings, clarity settings, white and black balances, and even into things like sharpness and noise reduction. Too many options for me to even remember. My main changes have been turning Energy Saving off, Auto Dynamic Contrast to High and LED Local Dimming to High.\n\nMy favorite things are (of course) the picture and the sound. The picture is GORGEOUS and the deep blacks are incredibly impressive. There've been times I've caught myself staring at the edges of the screen where a shadow or the black bar on the movie would seamlessly blend into the black bezel to the point where I genuinely couldn't see where the screen ended and the bezel began. It was the first thing I started texting my friend about after I set up the TV! And when the screen is black, it's BLACK. Not dark grey. Not bleeding in around the edges. Solid black.\n\nNow, because of how dimming zones work, there are cases where you might have something bright next to/inside something black, and you will see a bit of a halo around it. The size of this halo will depend upon your TV settings and how large/small the item is. I've attached some photos with examples. On the first, you can see a large halo around the big white box on the screen (which was visible in real life, but not even as drastic as it appeared on camera), but nothing around the magic mouse's cursor at the top of the screen, and the surrounding black screen that takes up most of the screen is still black. In the second, you can see where the darkness at the top of the screen all goes to solid black and the black bar totally disappears, while on the bottom you can still see it due to that edge of the picture being brighter.\n\nAnother picture-related thing that has really impressed me is how the screen captures reflective/shiny things like bits of metal or sequins or glass. I was watching a TV show where a character was constantly wearing clothes with chrome studs or holographic sequins, and the way they glittered and caught light was so REAL. In lower quality images, those kind of reflections will get crushed into just looking like a white spot, but no detail was lost in these reflections on this TV.\n\nAnd for those worried about angles, my couch is off to the side instead of directly in front of the TV and I've noticed no difference in the picture. Even right next to the side of the TV and staring straight across it, the image and colors never fade or look any different.\n\nThen for the sound part I mentioned, it also has a lot of customization options just like the picture and you get to choose between different sound modes and different outputs. Mine's currently on the AI Sound Pro mode and I have it set to output to Optical Out Device + TV Speaker. I had used my LG soundbar with my previous TV and carried it over to this one, and I'd never seen the option to use both before. I love it! It can sound a little strange if you don't balance the volumes correctly, but I've found keeping the soundbar volume 2 clicks higher than the TV speakers works really well. I find having the extra speakers give a lot of the sound effects a more nuanced sound. The deeper sounds really come through my soundbar/subwoofer, while the lighter ones come through the TV. There's this added feeling of sounds moving around without having a better sound set up, thanks to the extra set of speakers beyond my soundbar. Without the soundbar, the built in speakers are great for a TV. They're just not as \"deep.\"\n\nIf I had to nitpick and complain about something, it would probably only be the scroll wheel/select button the Magic Remote. It could be that I'm just not used to it yet (my previous LG TV did not come with a Magic Remote) or that my nails having grown out a bit at the moment are getting in the way, but it's not always the most comfortable to click. I often end up trying to press it and I'll press the ring around it at the same time. That or I'm trying to press it to select something and the wheel scrolls and switches to cursor mode instead. I would've preferred the scrolling and selecting being two separate buttons, but honestly it's not a deal breaker and it doesn't behave weirdly often enough that I want to replace it with something else. It's actually a really cool innovation to be able to scroll or use it like a mouse on your TV!\n\nAll in all, I really love the TV and I'm incredibly impressed (if you couldn't already tell from the lengthy review). If you want to upgrade and you want to upgrade like I did, then I highly recommend it!"

I am currently constructing a small build out for a in wall fireplace and a beef up area to put these mounts so I can have it flushed to the wall.

The remote is so so, not a fan of the mouse feature, but you just press a directional arrow to get out of it. Got a broken one from Amazon. Box wasn't strapped on delivery. Some probably complained about this TV and returned it. Then when I bought a NEW TV, Amazon shipped this one to me. This clearly wasn't a new TV. Amazon didn't replace, but they refunded and did pick up damaged product. Then I Bought it from BestBuy. Was delivered NEW before the Damaged on was picked up from Amazon. BestBuy also offered 24 months 0% financing. BestBuy offered a price match, so I was refunded $300 due to the price drop after purchase. Just a honest comparison"

I won't get into it, but if you're familiar with the key specs then you know what I mean. This set has a very nice picture and so much so that I purchased two. The second purchase was not because I wanted two, but because I came into the TV room one morning and the lower, right portion of the screen was cracked and half the picture was gone. How? Don't really know, but the general consensus is that my two dogs weighing in at about a hundred pounds each were 'horse-ing' around and made contact with the screen. So be it. The set is now installed about a foot and a half higher on the console cabinet. Hope that helps."

I do want to share couple of issue’s I experienced though for the next person. When going from an old none 1080p display upgrade your hdmi’s to 8k@60hz 4k@120hz with 48 Gbps data transfer trust me it makes all the difference also neither my xbox series x or ps5 would let me turn on or use allm or vrr until i did a hard reset on either console and you need to disable the hdmi cec setting on tv and both consoles before doing a reset notice you wont loose your games but you will have to download and update apps and resign in to everything afterwards this finally did get both my xbox series x and ps5 to finally recognize that my new display now supported everything fyi if your like me and carried over your old psvr from ps4 gen to your ps5 your hdmi setup will have to be recongfiged as well it is 1080p not 4k not happy about that but it is what it is just plug it back in when you want it I quess. Once I did all that everything works as it should full specs now as intended 4k@120 hdr dolby vision hdr10 allm vrr hgid it’s nice now can’t wait to finish my audio side now with full dolby atmos and dtsx hope my reveiw helps you next gen upgraders cause I couldn’t find any answers on ytube that helped me it took 2 days of aggravation to get it sorted out. Now go play on! And order an automatic hdmi switch your gonna need it for the 2.1 hdmi’s to run all your new tech Fyi i ordered the llano hdmi 2.1 four in one out 8k auto switcher and 2 rca to hdmi converters to convert and old ps2 and wii system to hdmi just to maintain usability since hdmi hookups is all the inputs the new lg qned85 has good luck"

The Google search led me to many Reddit topics that claim the 2022 model has this YouTube bug in the firmware that no one seems to know how to fix.\n\nHowever, there are several workarounds but none of them include fixing the tv YouTube application itself. To get my desired maximum resolutions especially for my 4K content, I can go through my PS5. I expect it works with my Xbox as well although I have not tested it. I have heard other methods work like Smart View but I have not tested that either. So again, there are definite workarounds that aren't too much of a pain but it's still a huge disappointment that this issue has not been fixed yet."

          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "Prior to this, I had a basic 65\" LG 4K Smart TV from 2018 that I'd originally thought was the greatest thing I'd ever seen. And it was beautiful and clear, but of course the blacks were never actually black because the light was always on and bleeding through. Last year, the wifi entirely failed and even the ethernet connection started acting funky this year. Some of the apps started getting laggy and didn't want to work at all on the older version/style of webOS on this TV (I couldn't even watch HBOMax on it, I always had to switch to my Xbox's app). Thus, I started thinking of upgrading and a big bonus from work gave me the ability to do so without worrying much about cost.\n\nI'm SO glad I got this TV.\n\nThe apps all work smoothly and there's no hiccups with wired or wireless internet. There are SO MANY customization options for picture and sound and you can set them separately for different inputs or apply it across all of them if you find a set up you like. I mean, you can change between modes, brightness settings, AI settings, clarity settings, white and black balances, and even into things like sharpness and noise reduction. Too many options for me to even remember. My main changes have been turning Energy Saving off, Auto Dynamic Contrast to High and LED Local Dimming to High.\n\nMy favorite things are (of course) the picture and the sound. The picture is GORGEOUS and the deep blacks are incredibly impressive. There've been times I've caught myself staring at the edges of the screen where a shadow or the black bar on the movie would seamlessly blend into the black bezel to the point where I genuinely couldn't see where the screen ended and the bezel began. It was the first thing I started texting my friend about after I set up the TV! And when the screen is black, it's BLACK. Not dark grey. Not bleeding in around the edges. Solid black.\n\nNow, because of how dimming zones work, there are cases where you might have something bright next to/inside something black, and you will see a bit of a halo around it. The size of this halo will depend upon your TV settings and how large/small the item is. I've attached some photos with examples. On the first, you can see a large halo around the big white box on the screen (which was visible in real life, but not even as drastic as it appeared on camera), but nothing around the magic mouse's cursor at the top of the screen, and the surrounding black screen that takes up most of the screen is still black. In the second, you can see where the darkness at the top of the screen all goes to solid black and the black bar totally disappears, while on the bottom you can still see it due to that edge of the picture being brighter.\n\nAnother picture-related thing that has really impressed me is how the screen captures reflective/shiny things like bits of metal or sequins or glass. I was watching a TV show where a character was constantly wearing clothes with chrome studs or holographic sequins, and the way they glittered and caught light was so REAL. In lower quality images, those kind of reflections will get crushed into just looking like a white spot, but no detail was lost in these reflections on this TV.\n\nAnd for those worried about angles, my couch is off to the side instead of directly in front of the TV and I've noticed no difference in the picture. Even right next to the side of the TV and staring straight across it, the image and colors never fade or look any different.\n\nThen for the sound part I mentioned, it also has a lot of customization options just like the picture and you get to choose between different sound modes and different outputs. Mine's currently on the AI Sound Pro mode and I have it set to output to Optical Out Device + TV Speaker. I had used my LG soundbar with my previous TV and carried it over to this one, and I'd never seen the option to use both before. I love it! It can sound a little strange if you don't balance the volumes correctly, but I've found keeping the soundbar volume 2 clicks higher than the TV speakers works really well. I find having the extra speakers give a lot of the sound effects a more nuanced sound. The deeper sounds really come through my soundbar/subwoofer, while the lighter ones come through the TV. There's this added feeling of sounds moving around without having a better sound set up, thanks to the extra set of speakers beyond my soundbar. Without the soundbar, the built in speakers are great for a TV. They're just not as \"deep.\"\n\nIf I had to nitpick and complain about something, it would probably only be the scroll wheel/select button the Magic Remote. It could be that I'm just not used to it yet (my previous LG TV did not come with a Magic Remote) or that my nails having grown out a bit at the moment are getting in the way, but it's not always the most comfortable to click. I often end up trying to press it and I'll press the ring around it at the same time. That or I'm trying to press it to select something and the wheel scrolls and switches to cursor mode instead. I would've preferred the scrolling and selecting being two separate buttons, but honestly it's not a deal breaker and it doesn't behave weirdly often enough that I want to replace it with something else. It's actually a really cool innovation to be able to scroll or use it like a mouse on your TV!\n\nAll in all, I really love the TV and I'm incredibly impressed (if you couldn't already tell from the lengthy review). If you want to upgrade and you want to upgrade like I did, then I highly recommend it!"

The remote and menus are very is easy to use and it has all the features you could ever want casting from an iPad or iPhone, laptop is very easy and the results are great if I wanted to be super critical, and maybe be a little bit unfair, this is extraordinarily heavy. I think it’s like 130 pounds. I’m fearful to use anything other than the LG special mounts to put this on the wall. I am currently constructing a small build out for a in wall fireplace and a beef up area to put these mounts so I can have it flushed to the wall. There may be people out there better at this than me, but I’m just a little fearful hanging such an expensive TV on the wall. Just my two cents please take this into consideration when purchasing."

Colors are amazing and it’s very easy to navigate. We got the preferred delivery and Amazon sent 2 guys to deliver , unbox and set up tv. They were very professional and did a great job. Didn’t leave a speck of styrofoam anywhere. I would definitely recommend the preferred delivery service. And you won’t be disappointed with this tv"

The remote is so so, not a fan of the mouse feature, but you just press a directional arrow to get out of it. Got a broken one from Amazon. Box wasn't strapped on delivery. Some probably complained about this TV and returned it. Then when I bought a NEW TV, Amazon shipped this one to me. This clearly wasn't a new TV. Amazon didn't replace, but they refunded and did pick up damaged product. Then I Bought it from BestBuy. Was delivered NEW before the Damaged on was picked up from Amazon. BestBuy also offered 24 months 0% financing. BestBuy offered a price match, so I was refunded $300 due to the price drop after purchase. Just a honest comparison"

          "review": "Even though this is a slightly older model and the new LG NanoCell/MiniCell TVs haven't yet hit the market, this one has the features that interest me. I won't get into it, but if you're familiar with the key specs then you know what I mean. This set has a very nice picture and so much so that I purchased two. The second purchase was not because I wanted two, but because I came into the TV room one morning and the lower, right portion of the screen was cracked and half the picture was gone. How? Don't really know, but the general consensus is that my two dogs weighing in at about a hundred pounds each were 'horse-ing' around and made contact with the screen. So be it. The set is now installed about a foot and a half higher on the console cabinet. Hope that helps."

No normal mount works for this TV, so avoid it unless you do not ever plan to mount it."

I do want to share couple of issue’s I experienced though for the next person. When going from an old none 1080p display upgrade your hdmi’s to 8k@60hz 4k@120hz with 48 Gbps data transfer trust me it makes all the difference also neither my xbox series x or ps5 would let me turn on or use allm or vrr until i did a hard reset on either console and you need to disable the hdmi cec setting on tv and both consoles before doing a reset notice you wont loose your games but you will have to download and update apps and resign in to everything afterwards this finally did get both my xbox series x and ps5 to finally recognize that my new display now supported everything fyi if your like me and carried over your old psvr from ps4 gen to your ps5 your hdmi setup will have to be recongfiged as well it is 1080p not 4k not happy about that but it is what it is just plug it back in when you want it I quess. Once I did all that everything works as it should full specs now as intended 4k@120 hdr dolby vision hdr10 allm vrr hgid it’s nice now can’t wait to finish my audio side now with full dolby atmos and dtsx hope my reveiw helps you next gen upgraders cause I couldn’t find any answers on ytube that helped me it took 2 days of aggravation to get it sorted out. Now go play on! And order an automatic hdmi switch your gonna need it for the 2.1 hdmi’s to run all your new tech Fyi i ordered the llano hdmi 2.1 four in one out 8k auto switcher and 2 rca to hdmi converters to convert and old ps2 and wii system to hdmi just to maintain usability since hdmi hookups is all the inputs the new lg qned85 has good luck"

Aside from this one issue I find it to be perfection.\n\nMy YouTube purchased movie content will not play Above 480p! Utter ridiculousness!!!\n\nI've tried everything from contacting LG support to doing my own Google search. The Google search led me to many Reddit topics that claim the 2022 model has this YouTube bug in the firmware that no one seems to know how to fix.\n\nHowever, there are several workarounds but none of them include fixing the tv YouTube application itself. To get my desired maximum resolutions especially for my 4K content, I can go through my PS5. I expect it works with my Xbox as well although I have not tested it. I have heard other methods work like Smart View but I have not tested that either. So again, there are definite workarounds that aren't too much of a pain but it's still a huge disappointment that this issue has not been fixed yet."

The TV seems unable to maintain its wireless network connectivity. On evenings where we watch a show, we have had to always re-connect our wireless network. Once we do so, the TV works just fine. No other device exhibits this behavior, including the roku device located right next to the TV. The TV has been updated to run the latest firmware, which has not helped the problem.\n\nWe have mixed views on the remote. On the one hand, the Wii-like pointer makes entering passwords a little faster, though you do have to get used to the sensitivity. It's impressive how it \"just works\", controlling the TV, sound bar, and Roku devices with no setup required. On the other hand, the layout of the buttons is not intuitive, and does not \"flow well\" with the TV menu. Compared to other remotes, the buttons are hard to find by feel in a dark room for movie nights where the lights might be low.\n\nIf the wireless problem mentioned above could be fixed, I would rate the TV at least one (if not two) stars higher."

Concerns about burn in and burn out led me in the QLED/QNED direction. My new LG QNED/Mini LED set has a beautiful picture. The picture is easily viewable from all seating angles in my living room. The picture is bright and clear. Blacks may not be as perfectly black as an OLED set but they are so black that I don't know if the difference would be noticeable unless the sets were side by side. The audio quality is an unexpected plus. I haven't had time to fish a fiber optic cable through the wall, so I have been using the built-in speakers. Not as much bass as I like but the audio quality is very good."

          "review": "I researched for months before deciding on a TV and not once did I do this in a store. Of all brands, It came down to this: Did I want a big \"name\" brand like Sony, Samsung or did I want more technology in the set itself to weatherproof myself against outdated technology in 2-4 yrs. I went with the later. Of all those choices of manufacturers, LG stands out as the most reliable choice with the least problems with awesome upgrades in features vs Sony, Samsung and for a better price.\nThe QNED line was our # 1 choice for screen techology and my best guess is QNED (similar to Samsung) will be the screen technology most popular going forward. Absolutely awesome picture in 4K Quantum Dot NanoCell Display from LG. Just read about QNED and you'll see why. OLED is too expe nsive and has reports of screen burn in, and a lower lifespan.\nSo in LG QNED, the choices were between this model 75QNED85UQA vs 75QNED80UQA and the 75QNED90UQA. 80 vs 85 vs 90? 80 is about $500 cheaper than 85 and 85 is less than the 90.\nAll have the same Wi-Fi standard (802.11ac) and the same connectivity -- HDMI-CDC simplelink (lets you use one remote to control all connected devices), and most important to us, the updated/latest HDMI 2.1 (4K @ 120Hz) on ports 3, 4 (4 total HDMI ports), plus HDCP 2.2 on all, plus HDMI ARC (is port 3), and an ethernet port, digital Audo Out (optical), and RF for Antenna/cable, and others. It does NOT have the older RCA composite or component connections for older devices but we purchased separately an RCA to HDMI converter for $11 for an older Wii.\nWe eliminated the 90 up front because it was 2021 modle with a older generation processor than either the 80 and 85, and it also had older WebOS Operating System, despite having full array diming pro backlight dimming technology and other features. Plus it was more expensive.\n\nSo between the 80 and 85, I chose the 85 because it has these features that the 80 doesn't.\nAudio: The 85 has Dolby Atmos The 80 doesn't\nBacklight type: Mini-LED vs Edge ****\nBacklight Dimming Technology: Precision in the 85 vs local in the 80\n100% Color Volume in the 85 not in the 80\nObject Brightness Booster in the 85 not in the 85\n******HDR: The 85 has Dolby Vision HDR (Cinema HDR Dolby Vision, HDR 10, HLG and Dynamic Tone Maping Pro. The 80 does NOT have Dolby Vision HDR or the pro version of tone maping *\n\nThe HDR was a key in choosing between the 80 and 85 but also the sound. It was worth the extra $$ to us as we plan to keep our TV for many years. Overall, the LG just outwitted, outsmarted and outplayed Sony and Samsung. Now set up, our 75QNED85UQA is unbelievably beautiful.\n\nOF course, we upgraded to HIGH END 8K HDMI cables to connect to our 4K Roku because those will transmit 4K @ 120Hz in HDMI ports 3, 4. Couldn't find a 4K cable that would do that but the 8K will. Also don't forget to upgrade your internet signal whomever it comes from -- and ifi you subscribe to Hulu, Netflix, etc . . . you'll need to upgrade your plans to the 4K plans or you're wasting your money on a 4K TV.\nWe've found that Netflix, so far, carries the most 4K movies and shows -- pages and pages full of them. And you can even see the fleas in the Bonobos beard in the National Geographic specials . . Absolutely awesome.\nLast, setup was a breeze. The TV is heavy -- the extra setup (paid for) was worth it. The TV is heavy."

          "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2022",
          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "Prior to this, I had a basic 65\" LG 4K Smart TV from 2018 that I'd originally thought was the greatest thing I'd ever seen. And it was beautiful and clear, but of course the blacks were never actually black because the light was always on and bleeding through. Last year, the wifi entirely failed and even the ethernet connection started acting funky this year. Some of the apps started getting laggy and didn't want to work at all on the older version/style of webOS on this TV (I couldn't even watch HBOMax on it, I always had to switch to my Xbox's app). Thus, I started thinking of upgrading and a big bonus from work gave me the ability to do so without worrying much about cost.\n\nI'm SO glad I got this TV.\n\nThe apps all work smoothly and there's no hiccups with wired or wireless internet. There are SO MANY customization options for picture and sound and you can set them separately for different inputs or apply it across all of them if you find a set up you like. I mean, you can change between modes, brightness settings, AI settings, clarity settings, white and black balances, and even into things like sharpness and noise reduction. Too many options for me to even remember. My main changes have been turning Energy Saving off, Auto Dynamic Contrast to High and LED Local Dimming to High.\n\nMy favorite things are (of course) the picture and the sound. The picture is GORGEOUS and the deep blacks are incredibly impressive. There've been times I've caught myself staring at the edges of the screen where a shadow or the black bar on the movie would seamlessly blend into the black bezel to the point where I genuinely couldn't see where the screen ended and the bezel began. It was the first thing I started texting my friend about after I set up the TV! And when the screen is black, it's BLACK. Not dark grey. Not bleeding in around the edges. Solid black.\n\nNow, because of how dimming zones work, there are cases where you might have something bright next to/inside something black, and you will see a bit of a halo around it. The size of this halo will depend upon your TV settings and how large/small the item is. I've attached some photos with examples. On the first, you can see a large halo around the big white box on the screen (which was visible in real life, but not even as drastic as it appeared on camera), but nothing around the magic mouse's cursor at the top of the screen, and the surrounding black screen that takes up most of the screen is still black. In the second, you can see where the darkness at the top of the screen all goes to solid black and the black bar totally disappears, while on the bottom you can still see it due to that edge of the picture being brighter.\n\nAnother picture-related thing that has really impressed me is how the screen captures reflective/shiny things like bits of metal or sequins or glass. I was watching a TV show where a character was constantly wearing clothes with chrome studs or holographic sequins, and the way they glittered and caught light was so REAL. In lower quality images, those kind of reflections will get crushed into just looking like a white spot, but no detail was lost in these reflections on this TV.\n\nAnd for those worried about angles, my couch is off to the side instead of directly in front of the TV and I've noticed no difference in the picture. Even right next to the side of the TV and staring straight across it, the image and colors never fade or look any different.\n\nThen for the sound part I mentioned, it also has a lot of customization options just like the picture and you get to choose between different sound modes and different outputs. Mine's currently on the AI Sound Pro mode and I have it set to output to Optical Out Device + TV Speaker. I had used my LG soundbar with my previous TV and carried it over to this one, and I'd never seen the option to use both before. I love it! It can sound a little strange if you don't balance the volumes correctly, but I've found keeping the soundbar volume 2 clicks higher than the TV speakers works really well. I find having the extra speakers give a lot of the sound effects a more nuanced sound. The deeper sounds really come through my soundbar/subwoofer, while the lighter ones come through the TV. There's this added feeling of sounds moving around without having a better sound set up, thanks to the extra set of speakers beyond my soundbar. Without the soundbar, the built in speakers are great for a TV. They're just not as \"deep.\"\n\nIf I had to nitpick and complain about something, it would probably only be the scroll wheel/select button the Magic Remote. It could be that I'm just not used to it yet (my previous LG TV did not come with a Magic Remote) or that my nails having grown out a bit at the moment are getting in the way, but it's not always the most comfortable to click. I often end up trying to press it and I'll press the ring around it at the same time. That or I'm trying to press it to select something and the wheel scrolls and switches to cursor mode instead. I would've preferred the scrolling and selecting being two separate buttons, but honestly it's not a deal breaker and it doesn't behave weirdly often enough that I want to replace it with something else. It's actually a really cool innovation to be able to scroll or use it like a mouse on your TV!\n\nAll in all, I really love the TV and I'm incredibly impressed (if you couldn't already tell from the lengthy review). If you want to upgrade and you want to upgrade like I did, then I highly recommend it!"

The remote and menus are very is easy to use and it has all the features you could ever want casting from an iPad or iPhone, laptop is very easy and the results are great if I wanted to be super critical, and maybe be a little bit unfair, this is extraordinarily heavy. I think it’s like 130 pounds. I’m fearful to use anything other than the LG special mounts to put this on the wall. I am currently constructing a small build out for a in wall fireplace and a beef up area to put these mounts so I can have it flushed to the wall. There may be people out there better at this than me, but I’m just a little fearful hanging such an expensive TV on the wall. Just my two cents please take this into consideration when purchasing."

The remote is so so, not a fan of the mouse feature, but you just press a directional arrow to get out of it. Got a broken one from Amazon. Box wasn't strapped on delivery. Some probably complained about this TV and returned it. Then when I bought a NEW TV, Amazon shipped this one to me. This clearly wasn't a new TV. Amazon didn't replace, but they refunded and did pick up damaged product. Then I Bought it from BestBuy. Was delivered NEW before the Damaged on was picked up from Amazon. BestBuy also offered 24 months 0% financing. BestBuy offered a price match, so I was refunded $300 due to the price drop after purchase. Just a honest comparison"

I won't get into it, but if you're familiar with the key specs then you know what I mean. This set has a very nice picture and so much so that I purchased two. The second purchase was not because I wanted two, but because I came into the TV room one morning and the lower, right portion of the screen was cracked and half the picture was gone. How? Don't really know, but the general consensus is that my two dogs weighing in at about a hundred pounds each were 'horse-ing' around and made contact with the screen. So be it. The set is now installed about a foot and a half higher on the console cabinet. Hope that helps."

I do want to share couple of issue’s I experienced though for the next person. When going from an old none 1080p display upgrade your hdmi’s to 8k@60hz 4k@120hz with 48 Gbps data transfer trust me it makes all the difference also neither my xbox series x or ps5 would let me turn on or use allm or vrr until i did a hard reset on either console and you need to disable the hdmi cec setting on tv and both consoles before doing a reset notice you wont loose your games but you will have to download and update apps and resign in to everything afterwards this finally did get both my xbox series x and ps5 to finally recognize that my new display now supported everything fyi if your like me and carried over your old psvr from ps4 gen to your ps5 your hdmi setup will have to be recongfiged as well it is 1080p not 4k not happy about that but it is what it is just plug it back in when you want it I quess. Once I did all that everything works as it should full specs now as intended 4k@120 hdr dolby vision hdr10 allm vrr hgid it’s nice now can’t wait to finish my audio side now with full dolby atmos and dtsx hope my reveiw helps you next gen upgraders cause I couldn’t find any answers on ytube that helped me it took 2 days of aggravation to get it sorted out. Now go play on! And order an automatic hdmi switch your gonna need it for the 2.1 hdmi’s to run all your new tech Fyi i ordered the llano hdmi 2.1 four in one out 8k auto switcher and 2 rca to hdmi converters to convert and old ps2 and wii system to hdmi just to maintain usability since hdmi hookups is all the inputs the new lg qned85 has good luck"

The Google search led me to many Reddit topics that claim the 2022 model has this YouTube bug in the firmware that no one seems to know how to fix.\n\nHowever, there are several workarounds but none of them include fixing the tv YouTube application itself. To get my desired maximum resolutions especially for my 4K content, I can go through my PS5. I expect it works with my Xbox as well although I have not tested it. I have heard other methods work like Smart View but I have not tested that either. So again, there are definite workarounds that aren't too much of a pain but it's still a huge disappointment that this issue has not been fixed yet."

          "review": "I wanted a very large HDTV. Check. I didn't want to go OLED as I had several plasmas and remember ghost images that were hard to go away due to \"slight\" burn-in. Check. I had read enough about the new very small nano LCD apertures to believe until individually addressable micro led direct view sets become affordable, LG QNED, and Samsung's similar Quantum Dot panels are the way to go. Check. I wanted brightness without crushing dark black Check. I wanted local dimming with the newer mini-led backlight technology. Check.\n\nSo, I took a chance and bought this set sight unseen. I didn't make a mistake I'm happy to say. This set can work in a well lit or dark room no problem. It can make levels of black look black, and with detail so no crushing. It has almost non-existent bloom across the entire screen when displaying white letters on black background for instance. It has a modern set of specs like compatible with HDR-10/Dolby Vision. There are a few things I'm thinking are not great, but certainly not deal-breaking stuff. Things like the remote is impossible to use in a dark space (and in my case without reading glasses). The sound isn't cutting edge stuff like the Sony sets that radiate a bigger and more wide-range soundstage using the entire front of the screen...although sound is adequate for now while I'm waiting to see if I can get the new Nakamichi Dragon surround set. Overall, I'm quite pleased with this TV and I'm writing this only a few weeks after paying about $500 more than the currently offered price. The TV is good enough this doesn't even cause me a case of sour grapes, though if I could I'd return it and order it again which I can't cause I threw away the box and packing materials. But make no mistake, I'd definitely buy it again. I have had several LG HDTV's beginning with their somewhat unusual (the only one ever on the market to my knowledge) rear projected 9\" CRT tube first ever HDTV then marketed under the Zenith name (a premium name they owned then). It had a great picture but developed problems with showing 720P (progressive inputs) and after repairing it twice they actually offered, and did, buy it back at over $4.5K. Now that's a stand-up company that cares about what they make and the consumer that shells out hard earned dough for their products. I recommend LG HDTV's now as well!"

          "review": "Had a brief hiccup involving a broken Optical Digital Audio port that came that way out of the box. But a quick replacement was sent within 48 hours. It's been TV viewing heaven ever since.\n\nIt's very bright without being overpowering. It has AI picture setup and that allowed me to get the ideal picture for me. That's good because it doesn't involve constant tweaking of the picture. For me it was, quite literally, a \"set-it-and-forget-it\" type deal.\n\nThe apps that come with it are decent to pretty good. The TV audio is decent, but I run the audio via the Optical Digital port to an old LG branded 5.1 home theater system and it sounds excellent! I do plan on upgrading to a sound bar in the not too distant future though.\n\nThe Magic Remote is just pure awesomeness! Interesting note: my previous LG TV from 2015 did not come with an actual Magic Remote just the circuitry. I could use my phone as one on that TV. 🤔\n\nI'm loving this TV. I just hope this \"love affair\" doesn't end any time soon."

          "review": "For years I’ve had a 49” LG, which I love, so I purchased another LG when I decided to upgrade to a 65”. LG has improved the interface- it’s so much easier to navigate content including the free LG channels than with the older model. The picture is crisp and bright. I docked a star because the sound isn’t up to par with my older LG. Regardless of the sound mode, it sounds distant and a little tinny so I’ll get a soundbar. Setup was super easy: it gives you the option to use your phone to connect the tv to the wifi and adjust the settings, which I found preferable to using the remote to type out passwords. I would say that this tv was worth the black friday sale price but I wouldn’t pay anywhere near retail due to the sound not being great.\n\nNot a huge deal but the cord could be longer. The cord begins toward the right side of the tv, so keep in mind that if your outlet is to the left of the tv, you’ll most likely need an extension cord. If you are getting the deluxe delivery, I recommend having an extension cord ready so that you can make sure the tv works before the delivery people leave.\n\nI used Amazon’s deluxe delivery and that went smoothly. It came on time despite the warning that it might not be delivered today due to the package being delayed in transit. I highly recommend the deluxe delivery option for larger tvs since they unpack it, assemble the stand, place the tv where you want it and take the packaging with them. And if there’s anything wrong with the tv, they’ll take it right back without hassle."

Not a good TV at all and I returned it after several failed attempts to do so from amazon returns team. You are expected to pack it back into its original box and it gets picked up without a proper inspection to ensure its noted that you have returned it in its original working condition . I felt this puts you at great risk of being held accountable for any damges that can accure in transit of return on a amazon delivery teams truck. At over $1000.00 I paid for it I worry greatly about getting this back in full. Not worth the money in quality and not worth the risk to return it."

The amazon smart tv features are good but i think i like roku format better. and id have to say im least impressed with the remote. its ok but i definitely cant brag about it. the mouse feature has been a little annoying so far and in my opinion every remote should come with a built in keyboard. I cant say its not worth the money but i just dont think spending the extra money for a better picture is worh it unless the difference is found when gaming which i havent done yet. It does support dolby and digital surround sound which im very happy with so far. im using the optical audio input to reciever and hdmi for video outs. sound is all you can hope for. picture is great. In a nutshell you will be happy with the tv just not sure you need to spend the extra money. dont forget to make sure you have the inputs and outputs for all the applications you want to access. this tv does cover all of mine which are more then most people that i know. Also i should mention that the box it shows in is enormous and almost intimidation when you need to get it in the house yourself. but i was able to lift and mount it on my swing arm wall mount by myself. i wouldnt recommend most try to do it alone though."

The remote is a little bit weird to use at first, but once you see that it can be used as a pointer, or just press around the thumb wheel, and you can press the either left, right, up, or down to make your selections it'll become easier to use.\n\nI'm using it with an antenna, and the picture is great on the 1080p stations, but you may notice a little bit of stutter on the lower quality stations.\n\nThe sound is a little bit tinny with the built in speakers. Using the fiber optic cable for the soundbar also came with a slight hiccup, where on some stations there was a 1-2 second delay on the sound, but when using the soundbar with an HDMI cable all is well.\n\nThis TV has a nice wide viewing angle. I'm currently using the Expert Night display setting, but I'm going to explore the other settings a little bit more, when I have the time. The Expert Night, Expert Day, Cinema, and Filmmaker settings were very similar in performance, and appear to be the best choices overall.\n\nI chose the expert delivery with set-up, and they were great. They showed up on time, set it up for me, and placed it on the stand, then took away all the trash associated with it, when the job was completed."

For example, dark scenes are much easier to see than with our previous TV.\n\nThe magic remote is very easy to use and gives 1 button access to your most used apps like Netflix.\n\nI can't say enough about this TV, outstanding product and value."

          "review": "For years I’ve had a 49” LG, which I love, so I purchased another LG when I decided to upgrade to a 65”. LG has improved the interface- it’s so much easier to navigate content including the free LG channels than with the older model. The picture is crisp and bright. I docked a star because the sound isn’t up to par with my older LG. Regardless of the sound mode, it sounds distant and a little tinny so I’ll get a soundbar. Setup was super easy: it gives you the option to use your phone to connect the tv to the wifi and adjust the settings, which I found preferable to using the remote to type out passwords. I would say that this tv was worth the black friday sale price but I wouldn’t pay anywhere near retail due to the sound not being great.\n\nNot a huge deal but the cord could be longer. The cord begins toward the right side of the tv, so keep in mind that if your outlet is to the left of the tv, you’ll most likely need an extension cord. If you are getting the deluxe delivery, I recommend having an extension cord ready so that you can make sure the tv works before the delivery people leave.\n\nI used Amazon’s deluxe delivery and that went smoothly. It came on time despite the warning that it might not be delivered today due to the package being delayed in transit. I highly recommend the deluxe delivery option for larger tvs since they unpack it, assemble the stand, place the tv where you want it and take the packaging with them. And if there’s anything wrong with the tv, they’ll take it right back without hassle."

Not a good TV at all and I returned it after several failed attempts to do so from amazon returns team. You are expected to pack it back into its original box and it gets picked up without a proper inspection to ensure its noted that you have returned it in its original working condition . I felt this puts you at great risk of being held accountable for any damges that can accure in transit of return on a amazon delivery teams truck. At over $1000.00 I paid for it I worry greatly about getting this back in full. Not worth the money in quality and not worth the risk to return it."

          "review": "I am happy with this TV overall. It is a great picture but Ive had a few vizios and insignias and so far I dont see the extra money I paid for the tech being worth it. The amazon smart tv features are good but i think i like roku format better. and id have to say im least impressed with the remote. its ok but i definitely cant brag about it. the mouse feature has been a little annoying so far and in my opinion every remote should come with a built in keyboard. I cant say its not worth the money but i just dont think spending the extra money for a better picture is worh it unless the difference is found when gaming which i havent done yet. It does support dolby and digital surround sound which im very happy with so far. im using the optical audio input to reciever and hdmi for video outs. sound is all you can hope for. picture is great. In a nutshell you will be happy with the tv just not sure you need to spend the extra money. dont forget to make sure you have the inputs and outputs for all the applications you want to access. this tv does cover all of mine which are more then most people that i know. Also i should mention that the box it shows in is enormous and almost intimidation when you need to get it in the house yourself. but i was able to lift and mount it on my swing arm wall mount by myself. i wouldnt recommend most try to do it alone though."

          "review": "Wow! The size of this thing. Coming from a 55\" TV This one is big. This is all around a very good TV. The remote is a little bit weird to use at first, but once you see that it can be used as a pointer, or just press around the thumb wheel, and you can press the either left, right, up, or down to make your selections it'll become easier to use.\n\nI'm using it with an antenna, and the picture is great on the 1080p stations, but you may notice a little bit of stutter on the lower quality stations.\n\nThe sound is a little bit tinny with the built in speakers. Using the fiber optic cable for the soundbar also came with a slight hiccup, where on some stations there was a 1-2 second delay on the sound, but when using the soundbar with an HDMI cable all is well.\n\nThis TV has a nice wide viewing angle. I'm currently using the Expert Night display setting, but I'm going to explore the other settings a little bit more, when I have the time. The Expert Night, Expert Day, Cinema, and Filmmaker settings were very similar in performance, and appear to be the best choices overall.\n\nI chose the expert delivery with set-up, and they were great. They showed up on time, set it up for me, and placed it on the stand, then took away all the trash associated with it, when the job was completed."

The setup instructions were very clear and easy to follow as well. I'm not a tech person so I cannot get into all the technical aspects, but I can say that this TV is amazing.\n\nMy only issue is getting used to the remote. The remote reminds me of using a mouse with the way it has a pointer. But that will be easy to get used to with time.\n\nAll in all, this was a great buy and I highly recommend it!"

          "review": "I wanted a very large HDTV. Check. I didn't want to go OLED as I had several plasmas and remember ghost images that were hard to go away due to \"slight\" burn-in. Check. I had read enough about the new very small nano LCD apertures to believe until individually addressable micro led direct view sets become affordable, LG QNED, and Samsung's similar Quantum Dot panels are the way to go. Check. I wanted brightness without crushing dark black Check. I wanted local dimming with the newer mini-led backlight technology. Check.\n\nSo, I took a chance and bought this set sight unseen. I didn't make a mistake I'm happy to say. This set can work in a well lit or dark room no problem. It can make levels of black look black, and with detail so no crushing. It has almost non-existent bloom across the entire screen when displaying white letters on black background for instance. It has a modern set of specs like compatible with HDR-10/Dolby Vision. There are a few things I'm thinking are not great, but certainly not deal-breaking stuff. Things like the remote is impossible to use in a dark space (and in my case without reading glasses). The sound isn't cutting edge stuff like the Sony sets that radiate a bigger and more wide-range soundstage using the entire front of the screen...although sound is adequate for now while I'm waiting to see if I can get the new Nakamichi Dragon surround set. Overall, I'm quite pleased with this TV and I'm writing this only a few weeks after paying about $500 more than the currently offered price. The TV is good enough this doesn't even cause me a case of sour grapes, though if I could I'd return it and order it again which I can't cause I threw away the box and packing materials. But make no mistake, I'd definitely buy it again. I have had several LG HDTV's beginning with their somewhat unusual (the only one ever on the market to my knowledge) rear projected 9\" CRT tube first ever HDTV then marketed under the Zenith name (a premium name they owned then). It had a great picture but developed problems with showing 720P (progressive inputs) and after repairing it twice they actually offered, and did, buy it back at over $4.5K. Now that's a stand-up company that cares about what they make and the consumer that shells out hard earned dough for their products. I recommend LG HDTV's now as well!"

          "review": "Had a brief hiccup involving a broken Optical Digital Audio port that came that way out of the box. But a quick replacement was sent within 48 hours. It's been TV viewing heaven ever since.\n\nIt's very bright without being overpowering. It has AI picture setup and that allowed me to get the ideal picture for me. That's good because it doesn't involve constant tweaking of the picture. For me it was, quite literally, a \"set-it-and-forget-it\" type deal.\n\nThe apps that come with it are decent to pretty good. The TV audio is decent, but I run the audio via the Optical Digital port to an old LG branded 5.1 home theater system and it sounds excellent! I do plan on upgrading to a sound bar in the not too distant future though.\n\nThe Magic Remote is just pure awesomeness! Interesting note: my previous LG TV from 2015 did not come with an actual Magic Remote just the circuitry. I could use my phone as one on that TV. 🤔\n\nI'm loving this TV. I just hope this \"love affair\" doesn't end any time soon."

          "review": "For years I’ve had a 49” LG, which I love, so I purchased another LG when I decided to upgrade to a 65”. LG has improved the interface- it’s so much easier to navigate content including the free LG channels than with the older model. The picture is crisp and bright. I docked a star because the sound isn’t up to par with my older LG. Regardless of the sound mode, it sounds distant and a little tinny so I’ll get a soundbar. Setup was super easy: it gives you the option to use your phone to connect the tv to the wifi and adjust the settings, which I found preferable to using the remote to type out passwords. I would say that this tv was worth the black friday sale price but I wouldn’t pay anywhere near retail due to the sound not being great.\n\nNot a huge deal but the cord could be longer. The cord begins toward the right side of the tv, so keep in mind that if your outlet is to the left of the tv, you’ll most likely need an extension cord. If you are getting the deluxe delivery, I recommend having an extension cord ready so that you can make sure the tv works before the delivery people leave.\n\nI used Amazon’s deluxe delivery and that went smoothly. It came on time despite the warning that it might not be delivered today due to the package being delayed in transit. I highly recommend the deluxe delivery option for larger tvs since they unpack it, assemble the stand, place the tv where you want it and take the packaging with them. And if there’s anything wrong with the tv, they’ll take it right back without hassle."

Not a good TV at all and I returned it after several failed attempts to do so from amazon returns team. You are expected to pack it back into its original box and it gets picked up without a proper inspection to ensure its noted that you have returned it in its original working condition . I felt this puts you at great risk of being held accountable for any damges that can accure in transit of return on a amazon delivery teams truck. At over $1000.00 I paid for it I worry greatly about getting this back in full. Not worth the money in quality and not worth the risk to return it."

The amazon smart tv features are good but i think i like roku format better. and id have to say im least impressed with the remote. its ok but i definitely cant brag about it. the mouse feature has been a little annoying so far and in my opinion every remote should come with a built in keyboard. I cant say its not worth the money but i just dont think spending the extra money for a better picture is worh it unless the difference is found when gaming which i havent done yet. It does support dolby and digital surround sound which im very happy with so far. im using the optical audio input to reciever and hdmi for video outs. sound is all you can hope for. picture is great. In a nutshell you will be happy with the tv just not sure you need to spend the extra money. dont forget to make sure you have the inputs and outputs for all the applications you want to access. this tv does cover all of mine which are more then most people that i know. Also i should mention that the box it shows in is enormous and almost intimidation when you need to get it in the house yourself. but i was able to lift and mount it on my swing arm wall mount by myself. i wouldnt recommend most try to do it alone though."

The remote is a little bit weird to use at first, but once you see that it can be used as a pointer, or just press around the thumb wheel, and you can press the either left, right, up, or down to make your selections it'll become easier to use.\n\nI'm using it with an antenna, and the picture is great on the 1080p stations, but you may notice a little bit of stutter on the lower quality stations.\n\nThe sound is a little bit tinny with the built in speakers. Using the fiber optic cable for the soundbar also came with a slight hiccup, where on some stations there was a 1-2 second delay on the sound, but when using the soundbar with an HDMI cable all is well.\n\nThis TV has a nice wide viewing angle. I'm currently using the Expert Night display setting, but I'm going to explore the other settings a little bit more, when I have the time. The Expert Night, Expert Day, Cinema, and Filmmaker settings were very similar in performance, and appear to be the best choices overall.\n\nI chose the expert delivery with set-up, and they were great. They showed up on time, set it up for me, and placed it on the stand, then took away all the trash associated with it, when the job was completed."

The settings interface is far different than anything I've been used to but once you figure things out , they're fine . The sound is average for a TV , but with a picture this good a sound bar really is in order . My only complaint is the remote . It isn't back-lit and the buttons have little to no tactile feel . I just about need a light on to use it . It does fit my hand nicely . The cursor is somewhat unique but a little hard to use at first . It has a setting to slow it down and that helped a lot . The cursor does make most operations faster than the also included , standard , four position cursor ring . Overall , I just love this TV after using it for the last month ."

          "review": "First off, this TV looks and sounds amazing. I bought the 43\" and it is perfect. The sound quality is amazing and the picture is crisp. Obviously a sound bar would enhance the audio, but it works very well without it.\n\nI'll add that I looked up a lot of reviews before purchasing this. Television reviews are wild and people are very nit picky. One thing I read that since this was an IPS panel, it'd look bad or be glaring. I currently have Christmas lights around the ceiling of my room and I can see them on the tv, but it's not going to ruin your viewing experience unless your watching a very dark movie. There is very little/almost no backlight bleeding as well.\n\nThe only thing I disliked is installing the legs. But that was my own fault because I was using a screw driver that was ever so slightly too small which made trying to screw the legs in difficult. Other than that this is an amazing TV and I full recommend this to anyone looking for a new television."

          "review": "Our last 55\" TV was an LG smart TV and was so easy to use. After 15 years it had to be replaced, so we thought we'd go with another lg. This unit had very good reviews and was the size we needed. It was very easy to set up and has a good picture, but that's that's where the pros end. As I had read, the magic wand rollerball is overly sensitive at times, them doesn't work at all. The interface is mind numbingly chaotic. The onscreen menus go on forever and there seems to be no easy way to maneuver through the options. LG also seems to have over 900 \"LG stations\", but they're all useless. Sorting through all the options takes forever, to the point that we're so frustrated we just give up. The basic picture technology is comparable to any other brand, but its the quality of the interface that makes this unit such poor choice."

BD/DVD player connected easily enough, and it recognized it, but that did not stop it from displaying a banner ever 3 seconds trying to get me to synch it to the BD player - no instructions for that, so the BD player is now unplugged - will have to figure that out.

I personally love it and the out of the box experience you get with LG tv’s. LG’s home menu isn’t the most user friendly but it’s easily usable and isn’t clunky. Things seem to load just fine and have had no issues with it. If you aren’t a fan of the remote or the home menu, which most people aren’t. I would highly suggest going with a similar samsung/sony tv.\n\nOverall, i’d give the tv an 8 out of 10. Picture quality is great and have had no complaints watching older movies, and content that is upscale to 4k. Obviously an OLED will have better image quality but for this price point i think it’s an amazing purchase.\n\nI can’t speak to much on the sound as i’m using this TV with a Sonos surround audio setup. That works great and no issues there."

          "review": "This is an amazing TV for this price. First off, it was the easiest TV EVER to set up. Seriously, talk about plug-and-play. You just plug in the power and boom, you have a smart TV. Sign in to any streaming channels you have and you're set. LG has their own smart TV software but it's very easy to figure out. It would be nice if they would get rid of the ads, but sometimes you just have to deal with that. Better than having to buy a separate smart TV player. The remote is a bit odd with the weird scroll button in the middle. I prefer the arrow keys but I'm getting used to this. It does have several buttons to take you right to the most popular streaming channels, but that's subjective as we aren't into Disney and I think Sling is an odd one to choose. I'd add in Max before that. It's a bit different to use than other remotes because you have to point it to the screen and there's a small laser light that works as a cursor when you are selecting something on the screen. This should be fun if I set this up to play streaming games. The volume and everything else work great so you just have the one remote. Still trying to figure out all the buttons but it was easy to use the basic functions right away.\n\nAs far as apps go, they had all the ones we subscribe to. I'm sure there are some missing but I haven't found any yet that I want that aren't here.\n\nThe picture is the next great thing. At this price, it's really quite good. It's very clear and I didn't have to make any adjustments for it to just look good right out of the box. And just super sharp. Almost too realistic at times, but I grew up with movies being a bit softened so the sharpness of new TVs still gets to me. I haven't noticed any blurring on things like action movies, but I don't tend to notice that. The colors seem good and I'll eventually play with the settings to see how to adjust it. But the colors are vivid without being blown out. And I haven't noticed any edge distortion so it's really nice to watch.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this TV. Mostly for the ease of set up. The remote takes getting used to but that's not a big deal. We could always buy a different one that has all the main functions we need. So, for this price, I definitely approve. And I've had good luck with LG TVs lasting a long time so we plan on keeping this as our main TV for many years."

          "review": " Overall, if you are someone who likes to edit lots of the system settings and prefer image quality over simplification, this would be a good upper middle tier TV for you. However, I prefer convenience.\n\nUnboxing:\n-This was easy to take out of the box with just 1 person.\n-The legs attached easily, and I appreciated the cable organizer that comes with it to add on the back.\n\nSetup:\n-Overall the setup of the TV was straightforward and you can easily follow the on-screen prompts. It started with a voice prompt setup that you can turn off, which spoke incredibly fast but it was intended for visually impaired individuals, which you can turn off.\n-It’s easy to sign in to apps using either the tv, your phone, or a laptop.\n-I did run into a problem during the initial bootup where I got a spinning circle of death. After waiting 25 minutes, I rebooted the TV and had to restart the setup from the beginning. Overall, including logging in all my apps, it probably took about 30 minutes.\n\nRemote:\n-They tried to do too much with the remote causing a lot of daily frustration.\n-My main concern is the “enter” or “ok” button in the middle of the arrows. It also acts as a scrolling ball, but many times when you push down for “ok” it ends up scrolling to another part of the page. It is very sensitive.\n-The remote has a motion control function which acts like a mouse and pointer but the arrow on the tv lingers too long after use and I find it to be distracting on the screen until it disappears by itself.\n-I also found the remote to be too old school with numbers for channels and buttons for almost everything you can imagine. I prefer the minimal and sleek remotes that come with many new TVs. This LG remote is about double the size and requires AA batteries instead of AAA.\n\nHomepage:\n-I am used to a very simplified homepage with roku where almost everything can be modified. This has all the bells and whistles, which provides plenty of options, but looks crowded and congested. Half the screen of the homepage is a giant ad for a streaming service I don’t use.\n\nScreen quality:\n-I had a 5 year old 55 inch TCL tv that I got for about $350. In my opinion, the picture quality of this LG TV is just slightly better. It has bright colors and people look a bit sharper in movies, but I wouldn’t say it’s worth the price difference from my old tv.\n-The screen has a standard amount of glare. I have a window on the opposite wall of the tv which reflects light in the morning. The window reflection is very visible especially when the screen is dark.\n\nGaming:\n-I have a nintendo switch I use to play games. The TV immediately suggests a gaming mode for best results. It has an easy to use gaming features to adjust setting quickly specifically for gaming."

After several attempts the TV turned on but the screen showed a bunch of lines across the entire screen before flickering in and out and then never powered on again.\n\nI tried reaching to Amazon to see if maybe I got a broken and malfunction unit but according to them because it's a large electrical item they would need to send a technician out to verify if it can be repaired or replaced.

This is perfect if you’re looking for a budget TV slightly higher than base models for casual viewing such as netflix, and light single player games since you don’t really need a 120hz TV if you’re not into competitive gaming so even though this can only run at 60hz, this is already good enough and enjoyable. LG is a very reputable brand, thus not just giving high quality TV, but also a manageable webOS. I wouldn’t say it’s blazing fast, but more in like ok for most people. As for the sound quality, it’s fine for normal circumstances but if you want the best cinema experience, then you need to get an external speaker. The package also came with very minor damage underneath the TV but I don’t really mind since you can barely notice it and it doesn’t affect the functionality. The price also was very competitive, much cheaper than in stores, so I’m very happy with my purchase since I also prefer LG TV’s over other brands."

The settings interface is far different than anything I've been used to but once you figure things out , they're fine . The sound is average for a TV , but with a picture this good a sound bar really is in order . My only complaint is the remote . It isn't back-lit and the buttons have little to no tactile feel . I just about need a light on to use it . It does fit my hand nicely . The cursor is somewhat unique but a little hard to use at first . It has a setting to slow it down and that helped a lot . The cursor does make most operations faster than the also included , standard , four position cursor ring . Overall , I just love this TV after using it for the last month ."

Obviously a sound bar would enhance the audio, but it works very well without it.\n\nI'll add that I looked up a lot of reviews before purchasing this. Television reviews are wild and people are very nit picky. One thing I read that since this was an IPS panel, it'd look bad or be glaring. I currently have Christmas lights around the ceiling of my room and I can see them on the tv, but it's not going to ruin your viewing experience unless your watching a very dark movie. There is very little/almost no backlight bleeding as well.\n\nThe only thing I disliked is installing the legs. But that was my own fault because I was using a screw driver that was ever so slightly too small which made trying to screw the legs in difficult. Other than that this is an amazing TV and I full recommend this to anyone looking for a new television."

This unit had very good reviews and was the size we needed. It was very easy to set up and has a good picture, but that's that's where the pros end. As I had read, the magic wand rollerball is overly sensitive at times, them doesn't work at all. The interface is mind numbingly chaotic. The onscreen menus go on forever and there seems to be no easy way to maneuver through the options. LG also seems to have over 900 \"LG stations\", but they're all useless. Sorting through all the options takes forever, to the point that we're so frustrated we just give up. The basic picture technology is comparable to any other brand, but its the quality of the interface that makes this unit such poor choice."

I personally love it and the out of the box experience you get with LG tv’s. LG’s home menu isn’t the most user friendly but it’s easily usable and isn’t clunky. Things seem to load just fine and have had no issues with it. If you aren’t a fan of the remote or the home menu, which most people aren’t. I would highly suggest going with a similar samsung/sony tv.\n\nOverall, i’d give the tv an 8 out of 10. Picture quality is great and have had no complaints watching older movies, and content that is upscale to 4k. Obviously an OLED will have better image quality but for this price point i think it’s an amazing purchase.\n\nI can’t speak to much on the sound as i’m using this TV with a Sonos surround audio setup. That works great and no issues there."

          "review": "This is an amazing TV for this price. First off, it was the easiest TV EVER to set up. Seriously, talk about plug-and-play. You just plug in the power and boom, you have a smart TV. Sign in to any streaming channels you have and you're set. LG has their own smart TV software but it's very easy to figure out. It would be nice if they would get rid of the ads, but sometimes you just have to deal with that. Better than having to buy a separate smart TV player. The remote is a bit odd with the weird scroll button in the middle. I prefer the arrow keys but I'm getting used to this. It does have several buttons to take you right to the most popular streaming channels, but that's subjective as we aren't into Disney and I think Sling is an odd one to choose. I'd add in Max before that. It's a bit different to use than other remotes because you have to point it to the screen and there's a small laser light that works as a cursor when you are selecting something on the screen. This should be fun if I set this up to play streaming games. The volume and everything else work great so you just have the one remote. Still trying to figure out all the buttons but it was easy to use the basic functions right away.\n\nAs far as apps go, they had all the ones we subscribe to. I'm sure there are some missing but I haven't found any yet that I want that aren't here.\n\nThe picture is the next great thing. At this price, it's really quite good. It's very clear and I didn't have to make any adjustments for it to just look good right out of the box. And just super sharp. Almost too realistic at times, but I grew up with movies being a bit softened so the sharpness of new TVs still gets to me. I haven't noticed any blurring on things like action movies, but I don't tend to notice that. The colors seem good and I'll eventually play with the settings to see how to adjust it. But the colors are vivid without being blown out. And I haven't noticed any edge distortion so it's really nice to watch.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this TV. Mostly for the ease of set up. The remote takes getting used to but that's not a big deal. We could always buy a different one that has all the main functions we need. So, for this price, I definitely approve. And I've had good luck with LG TVs lasting a long time so we plan on keeping this as our main TV for many years."

          "review": " Overall, if you are someone who likes to edit lots of the system settings and prefer image quality over simplification, this would be a good upper middle tier TV for you. However, I prefer convenience.\n\nUnboxing:\n-This was easy to take out of the box with just 1 person.\n-The legs attached easily, and I appreciated the cable organizer that comes with it to add on the back.\n\nSetup:\n-Overall the setup of the TV was straightforward and you can easily follow the on-screen prompts. It started with a voice prompt setup that you can turn off, which spoke incredibly fast but it was intended for visually impaired individuals, which you can turn off.\n-It’s easy to sign in to apps using either the tv, your phone, or a laptop.\n-I did run into a problem during the initial bootup where I got a spinning circle of death. After waiting 25 minutes, I rebooted the TV and had to restart the setup from the beginning. Overall, including logging in all my apps, it probably took about 30 minutes.\n\nRemote:\n-They tried to do too much with the remote causing a lot of daily frustration.\n-My main concern is the “enter” or “ok” button in the middle of the arrows. It also acts as a scrolling ball, but many times when you push down for “ok” it ends up scrolling to another part of the page. It is very sensitive.\n-The remote has a motion control function which acts like a mouse and pointer but the arrow on the tv lingers too long after use and I find it to be distracting on the screen until it disappears by itself.\n-I also found the remote to be too old school with numbers for channels and buttons for almost everything you can imagine. I prefer the minimal and sleek remotes that come with many new TVs. This LG remote is about double the size and requires AA batteries instead of AAA.\n\nHomepage:\n-I am used to a very simplified homepage with roku where almost everything can be modified. This has all the bells and whistles, which provides plenty of options, but looks crowded and congested. Half the screen of the homepage is a giant ad for a streaming service I don’t use.\n\nScreen quality:\n-I had a 5 year old 55 inch TCL tv that I got for about $350. In my opinion, the picture quality of this LG TV is just slightly better. It has bright colors and people look a bit sharper in movies, but I wouldn’t say it’s worth the price difference from my old tv.\n-The screen has a standard amount of glare. I have a window on the opposite wall of the tv which reflects light in the morning. The window reflection is very visible especially when the screen is dark.\n\nGaming:\n-I have a nintendo switch I use to play games. The TV immediately suggests a gaming mode for best results. It has an easy to use gaming features to adjust setting quickly specifically for gaming."

This is perfect if you’re looking for a budget TV slightly higher than base models for casual viewing such as netflix, and light single player games since you don’t really need a 120hz TV if you’re not into competitive gaming so even though this can only run at 60hz, this is already good enough and enjoyable. LG is a very reputable brand, thus not just giving high quality TV, but also a manageable webOS. I wouldn’t say it’s blazing fast, but more in like ok for most people. As for the sound quality, it’s fine for normal circumstances but if you want the best cinema experience, then you need to get an external speaker. The package also came with very minor damage underneath the TV but I don’t really mind since you can barely notice it and it doesn’t affect the functionality. The price also was very competitive, much cheaper than in stores, so I’m very happy with my purchase since I also prefer LG TV’s over other brands."

The settings interface is far different than anything I've been used to but once you figure things out , they're fine . The sound is average for a TV , but with a picture this good a sound bar really is in order . My only complaint is the remote . It isn't back-lit and the buttons have little to no tactile feel . I just about need a light on to use it . It does fit my hand nicely . The cursor is somewhat unique but a little hard to use at first . It has a setting to slow it down and that helped a lot . The cursor does make most operations faster than the also included , standard , four position cursor ring . Overall , I just love this TV after using it for the last month ."

          "review": "First off, this TV looks and sounds amazing. I bought the 43\" and it is perfect. The sound quality is amazing and the picture is crisp. Obviously a sound bar would enhance the audio, but it works very well without it.\n\nI'll add that I looked up a lot of reviews before purchasing this. Television reviews are wild and people are very nit picky. One thing I read that since this was an IPS panel, it'd look bad or be glaring. I currently have Christmas lights around the ceiling of my room and I can see them on the tv, but it's not going to ruin your viewing experience unless your watching a very dark movie. There is very little/almost no backlight bleeding as well.\n\nThe only thing I disliked is installing the legs. But that was my own fault because I was using a screw driver that was ever so slightly too small which made trying to screw the legs in difficult. Other than that this is an amazing TV and I full recommend this to anyone looking for a new television."

          "review": "Our last 55\" TV was an LG smart TV and was so easy to use. After 15 years it had to be replaced, so we thought we'd go with another lg. This unit had very good reviews and was the size we needed. It was very easy to set up and has a good picture, but that's that's where the pros end. As I had read, the magic wand rollerball is overly sensitive at times, them doesn't work at all. The interface is mind numbingly chaotic. The onscreen menus go on forever and there seems to be no easy way to maneuver through the options. LG also seems to have over 900 \"LG stations\", but they're all useless. Sorting through all the options takes forever, to the point that we're so frustrated we just give up. The basic picture technology is comparable to any other brand, but its the quality of the interface that makes this unit such poor choice."

TV starts with its interface, rather than the last place you left it (directtv). BD/DVD player connected easily enough, and it recognized it, but that did not stop it from displaying a banner ever 3 seconds trying to get me to synch it to the BD player - no instructions for that, so the BD player is now unplugged - will have to figure that out. Software interface is not easy/intuitive to maneuver."

I personally love it and the out of the box experience you get with LG tv’s. LG’s home menu isn’t the most user friendly but it’s easily usable and isn’t clunky. Things seem to load just fine and have had no issues with it. If you aren’t a fan of the remote or the home menu, which most people aren’t. I would highly suggest going with a similar samsung/sony tv.\n\nOverall, i’d give the tv an 8 out of 10. Picture quality is great and have had no complaints watching older movies, and content that is upscale to 4k. Obviously an OLED will have better image quality but for this price point i think it’s an amazing purchase.\n\nI can’t speak to much on the sound as i’m using this TV with a Sonos surround audio setup. That works great and no issues there."

          "review": "This is an amazing TV for this price. First off, it was the easiest TV EVER to set up. Seriously, talk about plug-and-play. You just plug in the power and boom, you have a smart TV. Sign in to any streaming channels you have and you're set. LG has their own smart TV software but it's very easy to figure out. It would be nice if they would get rid of the ads, but sometimes you just have to deal with that. Better than having to buy a separate smart TV player. The remote is a bit odd with the weird scroll button in the middle. I prefer the arrow keys but I'm getting used to this. It does have several buttons to take you right to the most popular streaming channels, but that's subjective as we aren't into Disney and I think Sling is an odd one to choose. I'd add in Max before that. It's a bit different to use than other remotes because you have to point it to the screen and there's a small laser light that works as a cursor when you are selecting something on the screen. This should be fun if I set this up to play streaming games. The volume and everything else work great so you just have the one remote. Still trying to figure out all the buttons but it was easy to use the basic functions right away.\n\nAs far as apps go, they had all the ones we subscribe to. I'm sure there are some missing but I haven't found any yet that I want that aren't here.\n\nThe picture is the next great thing. At this price, it's really quite good. It's very clear and I didn't have to make any adjustments for it to just look good right out of the box. And just super sharp. Almost too realistic at times, but I grew up with movies being a bit softened so the sharpness of new TVs still gets to me. I haven't noticed any blurring on things like action movies, but I don't tend to notice that. The colors seem good and I'll eventually play with the settings to see how to adjust it. But the colors are vivid without being blown out. And I haven't noticed any edge distortion so it's really nice to watch.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this TV. Mostly for the ease of set up. The remote takes getting used to but that's not a big deal. We could always buy a different one that has all the main functions we need. So, for this price, I definitely approve. And I've had good luck with LG TVs lasting a long time so we plan on keeping this as our main TV for many years."

          "review": " Overall, if you are someone who likes to edit lots of the system settings and prefer image quality over simplification, this would be a good upper middle tier TV for you. However, I prefer convenience.\n\nUnboxing:\n-This was easy to take out of the box with just 1 person.\n-The legs attached easily, and I appreciated the cable organizer that comes with it to add on the back.\n\nSetup:\n-Overall the setup of the TV was straightforward and you can easily follow the on-screen prompts. It started with a voice prompt setup that you can turn off, which spoke incredibly fast but it was intended for visually impaired individuals, which you can turn off.\n-It’s easy to sign in to apps using either the tv, your phone, or a laptop.\n-I did run into a problem during the initial bootup where I got a spinning circle of death. After waiting 25 minutes, I rebooted the TV and had to restart the setup from the beginning. Overall, including logging in all my apps, it probably took about 30 minutes.\n\nRemote:\n-They tried to do too much with the remote causing a lot of daily frustration.\n-My main concern is the “enter” or “ok” button in the middle of the arrows. It also acts as a scrolling ball, but many times when you push down for “ok” it ends up scrolling to another part of the page. It is very sensitive.\n-The remote has a motion control function which acts like a mouse and pointer but the arrow on the tv lingers too long after use and I find it to be distracting on the screen until it disappears by itself.\n-I also found the remote to be too old school with numbers for channels and buttons for almost everything you can imagine. I prefer the minimal and sleek remotes that come with many new TVs. This LG remote is about double the size and requires AA batteries instead of AAA.\n\nHomepage:\n-I am used to a very simplified homepage with roku where almost everything can be modified. This has all the bells and whistles, which provides plenty of options, but looks crowded and congested. Half the screen of the homepage is a giant ad for a streaming service I don’t use.\n\nScreen quality:\n-I had a 5 year old 55 inch TCL tv that I got for about $350. In my opinion, the picture quality of this LG TV is just slightly better. It has bright colors and people look a bit sharper in movies, but I wouldn’t say it’s worth the price difference from my old tv.\n-The screen has a standard amount of glare. I have a window on the opposite wall of the tv which reflects light in the morning. The window reflection is very visible especially when the screen is dark.\n\nGaming:\n-I have a nintendo switch I use to play games. The TV immediately suggests a gaming mode for best results. It has an easy to use gaming features to adjust setting quickly specifically for gaming."

After several attempts the TV turned on but the screen showed a bunch of lines across the entire screen before flickering in and out and then never powered on again.\n\nI tried reaching to Amazon to see if maybe I got a broken and malfunction unit but according to them because it's a large electrical item they would need to send a technician out to verify if it can be repaired or replaced.

This is perfect if you’re looking for a budget TV slightly higher than base models for casual viewing such as netflix, and light single player games since you don’t really need a 120hz TV if you’re not into competitive gaming so even though this can only run at 60hz, this is already good enough and enjoyable. LG is a very reputable brand, thus not just giving high quality TV, but also a manageable webOS. I wouldn’t say it’s blazing fast, but more in like ok for most people. As for the sound quality, it’s fine for normal circumstances but if you want the best cinema experience, then you need to get an external speaker. The package also came with very minor damage underneath the TV but I don’t really mind since you can barely notice it and it doesn’t affect the functionality. The price also was very competitive, much cheaper than in stores, so I’m very happy with my purchase since I also prefer LG TV’s over other brands."

The settings interface is far different than anything I've been used to but once you figure things out , they're fine . The sound is average for a TV , but with a picture this good a sound bar really is in order . My only complaint is the remote . It isn't back-lit and the buttons have little to no tactile feel . I just about need a light on to use it . It does fit my hand nicely . The cursor is somewhat unique but a little hard to use at first . It has a setting to slow it down and that helped a lot . The cursor does make most operations faster than the also included , standard , four position cursor ring . Overall , I just love this TV after using it for the last month ."

          "review": "First off, this TV looks and sounds amazing. I bought the 43\" and it is perfect. The sound quality is amazing and the picture is crisp. Obviously a sound bar would enhance the audio, but it works very well without it.\n\nI'll add that I looked up a lot of reviews before purchasing this. Television reviews are wild and people are very nit picky. One thing I read that since this was an IPS panel, it'd look bad or be glaring. I currently have Christmas lights around the ceiling of my room and I can see them on the tv, but it's not going to ruin your viewing experience unless your watching a very dark movie. There is very little/almost no backlight bleeding as well.\n\nThe only thing I disliked is installing the legs. But that was my own fault because I was using a screw driver that was ever so slightly too small which made trying to screw the legs in difficult. Other than that this is an amazing TV and I full recommend this to anyone looking for a new television."

This unit had very good reviews and was the size we needed. It was very easy to set up and has a good picture, but that's that's where the pros end. As I had read, the magic wand rollerball is overly sensitive at times, them doesn't work at all. The interface is mind numbingly chaotic. The onscreen menus go on forever and there seems to be no easy way to maneuver through the options. LG also seems to have over 900 \"LG stations\", but they're all useless. Sorting through all the options takes forever, to the point that we're so frustrated we just give up. The basic picture technology is comparable to any other brand, but its the quality of the interface that makes this unit such poor choice."

I personally love it and the out of the box experience you get with LG tv’s. LG’s home menu isn’t the most user friendly but it’s easily usable and isn’t clunky. Things seem to load just fine and have had no issues with it. If you aren’t a fan of the remote or the home menu, which most people aren’t. I would highly suggest going with a similar samsung/sony tv.\n\nOverall, i’d give the tv an 8 out of 10. Picture quality is great and have had no complaints watching older movies, and content that is upscale to 4k. Obviously an OLED will have better image quality but for this price point i think it’s an amazing purchase.\n\nI can’t speak to much on the sound as i’m using this TV with a Sonos surround audio setup. That works great and no issues there."

          "review": "This is an amazing TV for this price. First off, it was the easiest TV EVER to set up. Seriously, talk about plug-and-play. You just plug in the power and boom, you have a smart TV. Sign in to any streaming channels you have and you're set. LG has their own smart TV software but it's very easy to figure out. It would be nice if they would get rid of the ads, but sometimes you just have to deal with that. Better than having to buy a separate smart TV player. The remote is a bit odd with the weird scroll button in the middle. I prefer the arrow keys but I'm getting used to this. It does have several buttons to take you right to the most popular streaming channels, but that's subjective as we aren't into Disney and I think Sling is an odd one to choose. I'd add in Max before that. It's a bit different to use than other remotes because you have to point it to the screen and there's a small laser light that works as a cursor when you are selecting something on the screen. This should be fun if I set this up to play streaming games. The volume and everything else work great so you just have the one remote. Still trying to figure out all the buttons but it was easy to use the basic functions right away.\n\nAs far as apps go, they had all the ones we subscribe to. I'm sure there are some missing but I haven't found any yet that I want that aren't here.\n\nThe picture is the next great thing. At this price, it's really quite good. It's very clear and I didn't have to make any adjustments for it to just look good right out of the box. And just super sharp. Almost too realistic at times, but I grew up with movies being a bit softened so the sharpness of new TVs still gets to me. I haven't noticed any blurring on things like action movies, but I don't tend to notice that. The colors seem good and I'll eventually play with the settings to see how to adjust it. But the colors are vivid without being blown out. And I haven't noticed any edge distortion so it's really nice to watch.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this TV. Mostly for the ease of set up. The remote takes getting used to but that's not a big deal. We could always buy a different one that has all the main functions we need. So, for this price, I definitely approve. And I've had good luck with LG TVs lasting a long time so we plan on keeping this as our main TV for many years."

          "review": " Overall, if you are someone who likes to edit lots of the system settings and prefer image quality over simplification, this would be a good upper middle tier TV for you. However, I prefer convenience.\n\nUnboxing:\n-This was easy to take out of the box with just 1 person.\n-The legs attached easily, and I appreciated the cable organizer that comes with it to add on the back.\n\nSetup:\n-Overall the setup of the TV was straightforward and you can easily follow the on-screen prompts. It started with a voice prompt setup that you can turn off, which spoke incredibly fast but it was intended for visually impaired individuals, which you can turn off.\n-It’s easy to sign in to apps using either the tv, your phone, or a laptop.\n-I did run into a problem during the initial bootup where I got a spinning circle of death. After waiting 25 minutes, I rebooted the TV and had to restart the setup from the beginning. Overall, including logging in all my apps, it probably took about 30 minutes.\n\nRemote:\n-They tried to do too much with the remote causing a lot of daily frustration.\n-My main concern is the “enter” or “ok” button in the middle of the arrows. It also acts as a scrolling ball, but many times when you push down for “ok” it ends up scrolling to another part of the page. It is very sensitive.\n-The remote has a motion control function which acts like a mouse and pointer but the arrow on the tv lingers too long after use and I find it to be distracting on the screen until it disappears by itself.\n-I also found the remote to be too old school with numbers for channels and buttons for almost everything you can imagine. I prefer the minimal and sleek remotes that come with many new TVs. This LG remote is about double the size and requires AA batteries instead of AAA.\n\nHomepage:\n-I am used to a very simplified homepage with roku where almost everything can be modified. This has all the bells and whistles, which provides plenty of options, but looks crowded and congested. Half the screen of the homepage is a giant ad for a streaming service I don’t use.\n\nScreen quality:\n-I had a 5 year old 55 inch TCL tv that I got for about $350. In my opinion, the picture quality of this LG TV is just slightly better. It has bright colors and people look a bit sharper in movies, but I wouldn’t say it’s worth the price difference from my old tv.\n-The screen has a standard amount of glare. I have a window on the opposite wall of the tv which reflects light in the morning. The window reflection is very visible especially when the screen is dark.\n\nGaming:\n-I have a nintendo switch I use to play games. The TV immediately suggests a gaming mode for best results. It has an easy to use gaming features to adjust setting quickly specifically for gaming."

This is perfect if you’re looking for a budget TV slightly higher than base models for casual viewing such as netflix, and light single player games since you don’t really need a 120hz TV if you’re not into competitive gaming so even though this can only run at 60hz, this is already good enough and enjoyable. LG is a very reputable brand, thus not just giving high quality TV, but also a manageable webOS. I wouldn’t say it’s blazing fast, but more in like ok for most people. As for the sound quality, it’s fine for normal circumstances but if you want the best cinema experience, then you need to get an external speaker. The package also came with very minor damage underneath the TV but I don’t really mind since you can barely notice it and it doesn’t affect the functionality. The price also was very competitive, much cheaper than in stores, so I’m very happy with my purchase since I also prefer LG TV’s over other brands."

The settings interface is far different than anything I've been used to but once you figure things out , they're fine . The sound is average for a TV , but with a picture this good a sound bar really is in order . My only complaint is the remote . It isn't back-lit and the buttons have little to no tactile feel . I just about need a light on to use it . It does fit my hand nicely . The cursor is somewhat unique but a little hard to use at first . It has a setting to slow it down and that helped a lot . The cursor does make most operations faster than the also included , standard , four position cursor ring . Overall , I just love this TV after using it for the last month ."

          "rating": "5.0",
          "review": "This is an amazing TV for this price. First off, it was the easiest TV EVER to set up. Seriously, talk about plug-and-play. You just plug in the power and boom, you have a smart TV. Sign in to any streaming channels you have and you're set. LG has their own smart TV software but it's very easy to figure out. It would be nice if they would get rid of the ads, but sometimes you just have to deal with that. Better than having to buy a separate smart TV player. The remote is a bit odd with the weird scroll button in the middle. I prefer the arrow keys but I'm getting used to this. It does have several buttons to take you right to the most popular streaming channels, but that's subjective as we aren't into Disney and I think Sling is an odd one to choose. I'd add in Max before that. It's a bit different to use than other remotes because you have to point it to the screen and there's a small laser light that works as a cursor when you are selecting something on the screen. This should be fun if I set this up to play streaming games. The volume and everything else work great so you just have the one remote. Still trying to figure out all the buttons but it was easy to use the basic functions right away.\n\nAs far as apps go, they had all the ones we subscribe to. I'm sure there are some missing but I haven't found any yet that I want that aren't here.\n\nThe picture is the next great thing. At this price, it's really quite good. It's very clear and I didn't have to make any adjustments for it to just look good right out of the box. And just super sharp. Almost too realistic at times, but I grew up with movies being a bit softened so the sharpness of new TVs still gets to me. I haven't noticed any blurring on things like action movies, but I don't tend to notice that. The colors seem good and I'll eventually play with the settings to see how to adjust it. But the colors are vivid without being blown out. And I haven't noticed any edge distortion so it's really nice to watch.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this TV. Mostly for the ease of set up. The remote takes getting used to but that's not a big deal. We could always buy a different one that has all the main functions we need. So, for this price, I definitely approve. And I've had good luck with LG TVs lasting a long time so we plan on keeping this as our main TV for many years."

I've been team Samsung for years, but my brother convinced me to get an LG and I'm very pleased with this purchase. I was able to adjust the picture exactly as I wanted it, and the blacks are really black (this can be adjusted if it's too dark or too light). The remote takes some getting used to, but it's not bad. The sound from the speakers is also pretty decent, but I do use a sound bar. If you are looking for a good LG TV on a budget, I would definitely recommend buying this one."

The game mode on the TV also saw it as 120 fps, now that surprised me since this TV is only supposed to do 60hz maximum. I was pretty happy, but sadly anything else is stuck to 60hz. I use it mainly for Xbox and PC with colors and clarity being top notch. It's bright, vibrant, speakers are ehh. Control is nice I haven't accidentally pressed anything on it so far. I have no complaints it is an excellent tv."

          "review": " Overall, if you are someone who likes to edit lots of the system settings and prefer image quality over simplification, this would be a good upper middle tier TV for you. However, I prefer convenience.\n\nUnboxing:\n-This was easy to take out of the box with just 1 person.\n-The legs attached easily, and I appreciated the cable organizer that comes with it to add on the back.\n\nSetup:\n-Overall the setup of the TV was straightforward and you can easily follow the on-screen prompts. It started with a voice prompt setup that you can turn off, which spoke incredibly fast but it was intended for visually impaired individuals, which you can turn off.\n-It’s easy to sign in to apps using either the tv, your phone, or a laptop.\n-I did run into a problem during the initial bootup where I got a spinning circle of death. After waiting 25 minutes, I rebooted the TV and had to restart the setup from the beginning. Overall, including logging in all my apps, it probably took about 30 minutes.\n\nRemote:\n-They tried to do too much with the remote causing a lot of daily frustration.\n-My main concern is the “enter” or “ok” button in the middle of the arrows. It also acts as a scrolling ball, but many times when you push down for “ok” it ends up scrolling to another part of the page. It is very sensitive.\n-The remote has a motion control function which acts like a mouse and pointer but the arrow on the tv lingers too long after use and I find it to be distracting on the screen until it disappears by itself.\n-I also found the remote to be too old school with numbers for channels and buttons for almost everything you can imagine. I prefer the minimal and sleek remotes that come with many new TVs. This LG remote is about double the size and requires AA batteries instead of AAA.\n\nHomepage:\n-I am used to a very simplified homepage with roku where almost everything can be modified. This has all the bells and whistles, which provides plenty of options, but looks crowded and congested. Half the screen of the homepage is a giant ad for a streaming service I don’t use.\n\nScreen quality:\n-I had a 5 year old 55 inch TCL tv that I got for about $350. In my opinion, the picture quality of this LG TV is just slightly better. It has bright colors and people look a bit sharper in movies, but I wouldn’t say it’s worth the price difference from my old tv.\n-The screen has a standard amount of glare. I have a window on the opposite wall of the tv which reflects light in the morning. The window reflection is very visible especially when the screen is dark.\n\nGaming:\n-I have a nintendo switch I use to play games. The TV immediately suggests a gaming mode for best results. It has an easy to use gaming features to adjust setting quickly specifically for gaming."

Once it got delivered I took down my old TV and set up this one with my TV mounts that fit perfectly and mounted it. When I tired to turn it on nothing happened. I figured maybe I didn't plug in the power cable in correctly. After several attempts the TV turned on but the screen showed a bunch of lines across the entire screen before flickering in and out and then never powered on again.\n\nI tried reaching to Amazon to see if maybe I got a broken and malfunction unit but according to them because it's a large electrical item they would need to send a technician out to verify if it can be repaired or replaced. I haven't heard anything from them since and put up my old TV and threw this in the trash."

          "review": "This TV is so great to look at- the picture and video quality is gorgeous, you just need to have the right settings. This is perfect if you’re looking for a budget TV slightly higher than base models for casual viewing such as netflix, and light single player games since you don’t really need a 120hz TV if you’re not into competitive gaming so even though this can only run at 60hz, this is already good enough and enjoyable. LG is a very reputable brand, thus not just giving high quality TV, but also a manageable webOS. I wouldn’t say it’s blazing fast, but more in like ok for most people. As for the sound quality, it’s fine for normal circumstances but if you want the best cinema experience, then you need to get an external speaker. The package also came with very minor damage underneath the TV but I don’t really mind since you can barely notice it and it doesn’t affect the functionality. The price also was very competitive, much cheaper than in stores, so I’m very happy with my purchase since I also prefer LG TV’s over other brands."

          "review": "So everyone complains about sound on a led flat screen. Let’s be honest if you get any flat screen tv for the sound you’re not too smart of a consumer. They are meant for picture. Sound here is actually decent. But let’s be real. Get a sound bar set up. I got the Vizio 5.1 surround sound unit with wireless subwoofer and it works perfectly with this tv.\nPicture quality is great here. For the price point, this 4KUHD is a great option. Glad I purchased it. The interface is fine but I use the fire stick so I’ll stick with that. No issues with refresh rate in sports, wrestling, movies or games. Now a SONY 4k tv was what I wanted, but at the same size Sony wanted 300-$400 more and I just didn’t see the need to spend that. Especially when this one was a 4K tv at a price that made more sense. I purchased the 50 inch"

Sounds tinny and hollow, unlike all of my other LG's that sound great even without a sound bar.\nI broke down and purchased a LG 3.1 soundbar which makes it better but still not what it should be or as good as the older ones I have.\nOverall, I like the TV and the picture is fine, remote is a little marginal, but the sound is poor in comparison."

The picture is good, but not insanely great. The remote is unnecessarily complex - it has a point-to-move-the-cursor feature that works for some things and not others, even within LG's operating system functions, but the only \"OK\" button is also the wheel that activates the cursor. The OTA tuner picks up 10% fewer channels than the cheap Insignia it is replacing. The audio is tinny so I'll have to find a way to wedge in some kind of sound bar.\n\nThe box and the TV itself all have \"New for 2023\" language on them but I really can't find a practical difference between this and the older model.\n\nOverall, meh, but I overpaid for meh!"

I love the remote. The pointer also works with every USB mouse I tried. User tip: user your wrist not elbows and shoulders to operate it best. It's a want. You can do it Harry.\n\nI notice and appreciate the step up in size and im satisfied with the picture quality but Im not a turtle. The responsiveness of the user interface is frustratingly slo... but it also does more things to be fair. Here is the \"w\" you were waiting for.\n\nThe simple home popup in 2016 I preferred. The new full screen home takes long to open (2- 5 seconds) AND apps will not be where you left off when you to return them. They use to.\n\nThe screen off feature doesn't work in some aps.

I decided this 86in would fit my needs then would use the 75in in another room in the house..\nLet's start from delivery to unboxing then set up where flawless, can't believe the negative reviews or being damaged apon deliverey. I personally can't say anything bad about this tv its packed with features and a good detailed clear picture just go into settings and fine tune the picture settings ect. And you won't be disappointed.. also when watching the LG channels the movies are super clear and detailed just as expected... oh yeah did I mention football games look great too just make sure the settings for sports are tailored to your liking. Like smooth motion mode works great for sports.. just make sure you have good cables when connecting this tv so you get the most from it.. I currently have good HDMI cables and running FIBER OPTIC from the tv through my klipsch home theater system. Even Bluetooth/ wifi work with no problems.. bottom line don't cheap out when hooking your tv up... Updated with a short video showing just how good the picture is! Go steelers 😃\nUpdate a month after having time to enjoy this tv its better than expected! At the time of the first review there where only1 review now there's 26, alot of broken apon deliverey and others having issues.. so far no issues here and can't stress how good this tv is really is ! It's a shame there are so many broken or unhappy people out there! When buying anything on Amazon i always check out the reviews before I decide on purchasing, but when it comes to this monster of a tv trust the positive reviews! It definitely has a stunning 4k quality picture like I said in the beginning use quality cables or fiber optics..\nFYI: having only an antenna when watching your local stations actually\nBrodcast clear as streaming movies through wifi or Bluetooth!"

This thing is massive, has great picture quality and the 120hz refesh rate is a very noticeable improvement compared to my previous 60hz Vizio. It’s a heavy, sturdy and well made tv. The remote seems on the cheaper side but works fine. The smart features are adequate, fast and what I expected any new smart tv to have. I paid $1000 for it and it’s worth every Penny. If any problems occur or my opinion changes in the next couple years I will update this review accordingly. Enjoy because I know I will!!"

          "review": "Purchased to upgrade an aging LG 65\" TV that we moved to another room. Looked at a 75\" and 86\" TV before selecting the LG 86\". We are extremely happy with the size and quality! We sit approximately 10 feet front front and have chairs up to 45 degree angle off each side. All seats have a good viewing angle. Room has a lot of light from big windows. During day there is reflection from sun. Picture powers through the sun and we can still watch just fine. Every TV on the market would get a similar glare in our home. We can still watch TV.\n\nOur family does not use the TV for gaming or sports. The 120hz true motion is excellent on action movies. Colors are beautiful. Blacks are not grey; black and white backgrounds look good.\n\nAt 100 pounds you need two people to install the TV on a wall. Recommend two for unboxing and placing on a table mount if not wall hanging.\n\nWe do not use built-in LG TV smart features. Our use involves a roku, bluray, and over the air antenna. We stream through roku and love the experience. Also added a soundbar to fill room with sound that provided a theater experience. Highly recommend a soundbar with subwoofer. Rear speakers are a nice touch, although not required for a good sound experience.\n\nTV is highly recommended. Put in place, connect sound system, warm a bowl of popcorn, turn out the lights and enjoy a movie..."

I was going to let Wife pic out a sound bar next. We will get a Surround Sound at some time but the built in has options to make it also sound amazing.

They are meant for picture. Sound here is actually decent. But let’s be real. Get a sound bar set up. I got the Vizio 5.1 surround sound unit with wireless subwoofer and it works perfectly with this tv.\nPicture quality is great here. For the price point, this 4KUHD is a great option. Glad I purchased it. The interface is fine but I use the fire stick so I’ll stick with that. No issues with refresh rate in sports, wrestling, movies or games. Now a SONY 4k tv was what I wanted, but at the same size Sony wanted 300-$400 more and I just didn’t see the need to spend that. Especially when this one was a 4K tv at a price that made more sense. I purchased the 50 inch"

Sounds tinny and hollow, unlike all of my other LG's that sound great even without a sound bar.\nI broke down and purchased a LG 3.1 soundbar which makes it better but still not what it should be or as good as the older ones I have.\nOverall, I like the TV and the picture is fine, remote is a little marginal, but the sound is poor in comparison."

But using it as a \"dumb\" tv (with wifi disabled), works great. Powers on very fast, powers off just as fast.

The picture is good, but not insanely great. The remote is unnecessarily complex - it has a point-to-move-the-cursor feature that works for some things and not others, even within LG's operating system functions, but the only \"OK\" button is also the wheel that activates the cursor. The OTA tuner picks up 10% fewer channels than the cheap Insignia it is replacing. The audio is tinny so I'll have to find a way to wedge in some kind of sound bar.\n\nThe box and the TV itself all have \"New for 2023\" language on them but I really can't find a practical difference between this and the older model.\n\nOverall, meh, but I overpaid for meh!"

They are meant for picture. Sound here is actually decent. But let’s be real. Get a sound bar set up. I got the Vizio 5.1 surround sound unit with wireless subwoofer and it works perfectly with this tv.\nPicture quality is great here. For the price point, this 4KUHD is a great option. Glad I purchased it. The interface is fine but I use the fire stick so I’ll stick with that. No issues with refresh rate in sports, wrestling, movies or games. Now a SONY 4k tv was what I wanted, but at the same size Sony wanted 300-$400 more and I just didn’t see the need to spend that. Especially when this one was a 4K tv at a price that made more sense. I purchased the 50 inch"

The picture is good, but not insanely great. The remote is unnecessarily complex - it has a point-to-move-the-cursor feature that works for some things and not others, even within LG's operating system functions, but the only \"OK\" button is also the wheel that activates the cursor. The OTA tuner picks up 10% fewer channels than the cheap Insignia it is replacing. The audio is tinny so I'll have to find a way to wedge in some kind of sound bar.\n\nThe box and the TV itself all have \"New for 2023\" language on them but I really can't find a practical difference between this and the older model.\n\nOverall, meh, but I overpaid for meh!"

I love the remote. The pointer also works with every USB mouse I tried. User tip: user your wrist not elbows and shoulders to operate it best. It's a want. You can do it Harry.\n\nI notice and appreciate the step up in size and im satisfied with the picture quality but Im not a turtle. The responsiveness of the user interface is frustratingly slo... but it also does more things to be fair. Here is the \"w\" you were waiting for.\n\nThe simple home popup in 2016 I preferred.

It was late in the evening but they responded quickly in letting us know what we needed to do to get a return started with Amazon.\nThe 98 inch Samsung TV is a huge TV and weighs in at over 150 pounds. Modia arranged a pickup with sufficient manpower to handle the TV.\nWe did wind up buying the TV again. The picture is stunning compared to the previous DLP TV we had. We would definitely buy again from Modia. They provided awesome service every step of the way."

Plugged it in before doing anything else and the power indicator turns red so the TV has power, but no picture would display on the screen and it would stay black/blank. I tried everything in the book, unplugging appliances, plugging it in a new outlet, tested the original outlet where the TV would go, used an extension cord, tried all the troubleshooting steps, checking the circuit breakers, you name it. Super frustrating waiting a week and planning a time to be home to sign for the TV just for it to not work 1 hour of it arriving to my home. Sat on the phone with amazon for 47 minutes to be put on hold for 40 of those minutes and then get hung up on. I call a second time and again, I get put on hold for 32 minutes and then finally get routed to a person that was able to help me. The replacement will take another week to get here so I’ll update this review if the next TV works."

The first tv we received had an extremely damaged screen. We plugged it in, it came on, and the screen looked shattered once turned on. We couldn’t see anything. You couldn’t see this until the tv was turned on as the actual physical screen looked perfect. Something was wrong inside. We had to repackage the huge tv and take it to the UPS store to return it. Had a replacement sent. We plugged this one in first and thankfully it came on perfectly. This is the largest tv we have ever owned, and it’s amazing how we can see details we never could before on our smaller tv. While it’s not the largest tv, it’s quite large for us. Plenty large. Makes things easier to see for my nearsighted eyes. Very pleased so far. Easy to add all of our streaming apps. It keeps asking us to connect to our wifi, and our old tv never did that, so hopefully that won’t be an ongoing issue. Overall, this is a super nice tv!"

I expected this TV to have better picture quality since technology has improved since, but was disappointed. The default colors were quite light and I had to play around with the color/picture controls manually to make them better. Brightness was also too high by default.\n\nUnless you sign up for a Samsung account, calibration capabilities with a mobile phone are not available. So finally I signed up for a Samsung account and then tried to calibrate with an S23 mobile phone. The result was a better picture, but not as good as the older plasma one.\n\nOf course there are quite a number of other features that comes with the TV, like apps, webcam addition, using your mobile phone camera, fireTV remote emulation, 4K streaming, embedded manuals and such... These are appreciated, but the primary use case is picture quality, where it did not quite meet the THX Cinema quality of the earlier plasma model."

          "rating": "4.0",
          "review": "The TV is great.\n\nI paired it with the Sanus tilt mount, but dont make the same mistake I did and assume the mounting screws are centered vertically on the TV. I think they are offset by 3 inches, which by the grace of god still allowed me to mount this monster with millimeters of clearance.\n\nAlso for the Sanus mount I ended up having to use the 25mm M8 screws with a 5mm stand off as well as the included washer. So dont assume the 16mm M8 screws in the Sanus kit will fit, they were too short for me.\n\nSamsung is a solid brand with app features to boot. If you dont care about built in app support, I suppose you could go even cheaper with the TCL 98\" but for the extra grand it was worth it to me to get Samsung. I was between this and the Sony 100\" which gets you 2 inches extra diagonal and Dolby Vision but it was also 3k more. Wasnt worth it to me.\n\nIf i were to splurge I'd go for the QN 90A 98\" by Samsung. Unlimited cash I'd go with the 110\" LG OLED.\n\nThe box is enormous. I had to unpack and get a friend to safely get it into the basement after removing the hand rails. So be mindful of delivery because if you're moving this to anywhere beyond a direct entryway, you may find yourself stuck.\n\nThe picture is what you would expect from an LED. There's a considerable difference with blooming/bleed in high contrast scenes, but I'm comparing to LG OLED, which is insanely better but also much more costly. Also the OLED suffers from screen burn. I have a roughly 7 year old LG 65\" OLED that's been performing wonderfully to this day but now is showing signs of wear on images with a noticable split down the middle on darker images.\n\nOver all Im happy with my purchase. If you have the extra cash go with the QN, otherwise this is a solis contender."

This is another TV where it is on the OPPOSITE side from where all the other cords go. The power cord is short, which complicates putting it on the wall. Being on the opposite side of all the other cords, complicates putting them all behind the wall. The TV is incredible, but the power cord is ridiculously small and not in a good spot on the back.\n\nI have 2 Samsung TV in my room. The other is a 52”. I prefer using it as my computer monitor. A top rated sci-fi movie just became available for purchase, so we got it to watch on the new TV, and it was incredible. The sound was EXCELLENT. The picture was BEAUTIFUL, CLEAR, and VIVID(See pictures). I like how the remote doesn’t require batteries but is solar-powered. It’s about time someone thought of that. The “SmartThings” app is an excellent idea, especially with having to sign in to all the streaming services. The app makes setting up the TV less frustrating.\n\nThe PRICE for this 55” inch OLED is in the usual range. It’s exactly as advertised."

I still like the app selection better from a Roku (this doesn't have the NCAA March Madness app, for example) so will still use my Roku with this TV.\n\nI also use an antenna for local channels. I love the channel guide that shows my channels and what is playing on each channel.\n\nOne other thing that I love is that you can do a split screen and have two inputs show at the same time. So I could use my Roku to watch one game on March Madness and another screen to watch another game on my antenna! You can do picture-in-picture or side-by-side and chose the size of the main screen."

The cord for the TV is really nice and small so it is easy to fit on our power strip. The remote is so cool! It is solar powered and really high tech. We're still figuring this tv out even though it is very user friendly, there is just so much do do on it! Quality is out of this world amazing, like you will see pimples and gross skin daily good lol."

Modia arranged a pickup with sufficient manpower to handle the TV.\nWe did wind up buying the TV again. The picture is stunning compared to the previous DLP TV we had. We would definitely buy again from Modia. They provided awesome service every step of the way."

Plugged it in before doing anything else and the power indicator turns red so the TV has power, but no picture would display on the screen and it would stay black/blank. I tried everything in the book, unplugging appliances, plugging it in a new outlet, tested the original outlet where the TV would go, used an extension cord, tried all the troubleshooting steps, checking the circuit breakers, you name it. Super frustrating waiting a week and planning a time to be home to sign for the TV just for it to not work 1 hour of it arriving to my home. Sat on the phone with amazon for 47 minutes to be put on hold for 40 of those minutes and then get hung up on. I call a second time and again, I get put on hold for 32 minutes and then finally get routed to a person that was able to help me. The replacement will take another week to get here so I’ll update this review if the next TV works."

The first tv we received had an extremely damaged screen. We plugged it in, it came on, and the screen looked shattered once turned on. We couldn’t see anything. You couldn’t see this until the tv was turned on as the actual physical screen looked perfect. Something was wrong inside. We had to repackage the huge tv and take it to the UPS store to return it. Had a replacement sent. We plugged this one in first and thankfully it came on perfectly. This is the largest tv we have ever owned, and it’s amazing how we can see details we never could before on our smaller tv. While it’s not the largest tv, it’s quite large for us. Plenty large. Makes things easier to see for my nearsighted eyes. Very pleased so far. Easy to add all of our streaming apps. It keeps asking us to connect to our wifi, and our old tv never did that, so hopefully that won’t be an ongoing issue. Overall, this is a super nice tv!"

I expected this TV to have better picture quality since technology has improved since, but was disappointed. The default colors were quite light and I had to play around with the color/picture controls manually to make them better. Brightness was also too high by default.\n\nUnless you sign up for a Samsung account, calibration capabilities with a mobile phone are not available. So finally I signed up for a Samsung account and then tried to calibrate with an S23 mobile phone. The result was a better picture, but not as good as the older plasma one.\n\nOf course there are quite a number of other features that comes with the TV, like apps, webcam addition, using your mobile phone camera, fireTV remote emulation, 4K streaming, embedded manuals and such... These are appreciated, but the primary use case is picture quality, where it did not quite meet the THX Cinema quality of the earlier plasma model."

          "rating": "4.0",
          "review": "The TV is great.\n\nI paired it with the Sanus tilt mount, but dont make the same mistake I did and assume the mounting screws are centered vertically on the TV. I think they are offset by 3 inches, which by the grace of god still allowed me to mount this monster with millimeters of clearance.\n\nAlso for the Sanus mount I ended up having to use the 25mm M8 screws with a 5mm stand off as well as the included washer. So dont assume the 16mm M8 screws in the Sanus kit will fit, they were too short for me.\n\nSamsung is a solid brand with app features to boot. If you dont care about built in app support, I suppose you could go even cheaper with the TCL 98\" but for the extra grand it was worth it to me to get Samsung. I was between this and the Sony 100\" which gets you 2 inches extra diagonal and Dolby Vision but it was also 3k more. Wasnt worth it to me.\n\nIf i were to splurge I'd go for the QN 90A 98\" by Samsung. Unlimited cash I'd go with the 110\" LG OLED.\n\nThe box is enormous. I had to unpack and get a friend to safely get it into the basement after removing the hand rails. So be mindful of delivery because if you're moving this to anywhere beyond a direct entryway, you may find yourself stuck.\n\nThe picture is what you would expect from an LED. There's a considerable difference with blooming/bleed in high contrast scenes, but I'm comparing to LG OLED, which is insanely better but also much more costly. Also the OLED suffers from screen burn. I have a roughly 7 year old LG 65\" OLED that's been performing wonderfully to this day but now is showing signs of wear on images with a noticable split down the middle on darker images.\n\nOver all Im happy with my purchase. If you have the extra cash go with the QN, otherwise this is a solis contender."

          "review": "Samsung has always been one of the leading names in the electronics industry, and their latest offering, the Samsung 55-Inch Class QLED 4K Q80C Series modrl, is no exception. This television is an exceptional piece of technology, and I was lucky enough to get my hands on one to review. Not only is it packed with top-of-the-line features, but it also manages to be incredibly beautiful. In this review, I’ll be taking a closer look at the Samsung Q80C and telling you all about its features and the clever way they’ve been implemented.\n\n//Design:\n\nLet’s start with the design. The Samsung Q80C is an absolute stunner. It has a sleek, modern design that would look great in any living room. The television is very slim, and the bezels are almost nonexistent. This means that you get an almost edge-to-edge display, which is perfect for a more immersive viewing experience.\n\nBut the best part about the design is the way it’s been implemented with the Q80C’s Smart TV features. The television’s design is so sleek and seamless that it feels like the entire TV is one big Smart Hub. The Q80C’s Smart TV features are so intuitive that you’ll never want to go back to a regular remote. The remote is even designed to look like a gaming controller, which is a hilarious nod to the fact that this TV is great for gaming.\n\n//Display:\n\nMoving on to the display, the Samsung Q80C features a 55-inch QLED display with a resolution of 4K. This means that you’re getting an incredibly sharp and detailed picture. The colors are vivid and bright, and the blacks are deep and dark. The QLED technology also means that the TV has a very high contrast ratio, which is great for watching movies and TV shows with a lot of dark scenes.\n\nBut what really sets the Samsung Q80C apart from other televisions is the Quantum HDR+ technology. This technology uses a combination of HDR10+ and HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) to produce an even wider range of colors and brightness levels. This means that the TV is able to display more realistic colors, which is especially noticeable in nature documentaries and other shows with lots of bright colors. And once again, Samsung manages to inject humor into their technology by making the Q80C’s picture so vivid that it’s almost like you’re actually there.\n\n//Sound:\n\nThe sound on the Samsung Q80C is also something special. The TV features Dolby Atmos Object Tracking Sound Lite, which is a mouthful to say but basically means that the TV is able to produce a more immersive and directional sound experience. This is especially noticeable when watching action movies or playing video games, where the sound can help you locate enemies or explosions.\n\nBut Samsung doesn’t stop there. They’ve also included Q-Symphony 3.0, which is a feature that allows the TV to work in sync with your soundbar or home theater system. This means that you can get even better sound quality without having to worry about syncing issues.\n\nAnd once again, Samsung is injecting so much data into their technology by making the Q80C’s sound so immersive that it’s like you’re actually in the action. But they take it a step further by including a feature called “Object Tracking Sound Lite,” which sounds like something out of a science fiction movie.\n\n//Gaming:\n\nThe Samsung Q80C is also great for gaming. The TV has a Game Mode, which reduces input lag and optimizes the picture fora better gaming experience. This means that you can play your favorite games without having to worry about lag or any visual issues.\n\nBut what really sets the Samsung Q80C apart for gamers is the Gaming Hub. This feature is a one-stop-shop for all your gaming needs. It allows you to access all your favorite gaming apps, like Twitch and Discord, without having to switch inputs or navigate through menus. This is a game-changer for gamers, as it makes it much easier to access everything you need to get your gaming fix.\n\nThe Q80C’s Game Mode so good that you’ll forget you’re not actually in the game. And the Gaming Hub is so convenient that you’ll never want to leave your couch.\n\n//Smart TV Features:\n\nThe Samsung Q80C is also packed with Smart TV features. It has Alexa built-in, which means that you can control your TV with your voice. This is especially convenient for when you can’t find the remote or when you’re too lazy to get up off the couch.\n\nBut Samsung takes it a step further by making the Q80C’s Smart TV features so intuitive that you’ll feel like you’re living in the future. The TV’s Smart Hub allows you to easily access all your favorite apps and streaming services, and the OneRemote allows you to control all your devices with just one remote. Samsung’s Smart TV features are so seamless that you’ll never want to go back to a regular TV.\n\n//Conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, the Samsung 55-Inch Class QLED 4K Q80C Series, is an exceptional piece of technology. It’s packed with top-of-the-line features that make it great for everything from watching movies to playing video games. But what really sets the Q80C apart is the way that Samsung injects humor into their technology. They manage to make their features both informative and funny, which makes using the TV a joy.\n\nThe Q80C’s design is sleek and modern, and the display is incredibly sharp and vivid. The sound is immersive and directional, and the TV is great for gaming. The Smart TV features are intuitive and convenient, and Alexa built-in makes controlling your TV a breeze.\n\n//Overall, the Q80C Series is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a great TV. It's got everything you could want in a TV, and it's sure to impress your friends and family.\n\n----------------\n\nIf you made it this far through my review, then here's a funny story about the TV:\n\nI was watching a movie on the TV, and I got so engrossed in the story that I forgot to turn on the subtitles. I didn't realize this until I heard a character say something that I didn't understand. I looked down at the TV and saw that the subtitles were turned off. I laughed out loud and said to myself, \"I'm such an idiot.\"\n\nI turned on the subtitles and continued watching the movie. I was able to understand everything that was being said, and I enjoyed the movie even more.\n\nMoral of the story: Always turn on the subtitles when you're watching a movie on a TV. It will make your viewing experience much more enjoyable.. If you’re in the market for a new TV, I highly recommend checking out the Samsung Q80C, a television that's so packed with features, it's like a Swiss army knife for your entertainment center. You won’t be disappointed."

          "rating": "3.0",
          "review": "Update:\n\nThe TV was delivered on March 27th, and on April 30th I noticed that the brightness of the screen started flickering while watching a BluRay.. Then, I went to bed and turned the TV off, got up the next morning and found that the TV would turn on, but I would get no screen.. I only use the TV about 12 hours a day at the most.. Some days, it may not even get turned on.. If I shined a flashlight onto the screen, I could make out the picture in the background, but it was like the light in the back of the TV went out.. I ended up getting help and they had me hold the power button down on the remote for a few seconds until the TV rebooted.. After I did, which took something like 5 or so seconds, the TV did reboot and is now working fine.. I guess it is because it gets a build up of static on the inside, and rebooting it discharges all that static.. I have never had a TV do this before, so this is a first for me.. If you have this problem too, then try this before you do anything else..\n\nOriginal post: (with a few minor updates)\n\nMy first complaint, which I do not understand why it happened, but I tried to change channels once and when I did, it just came up with a big box in the middle of the screen that said scanning or something.. I had been using it for a while, so this was not just installed when it did this.. But it did this a couple of times in a row.. I went to the home menu screen, and then back, and it has never done that again.. Glitch?? I think I was on OTA TV at the time.. I never had the problem again after that (a month later)..\n\nThe picture viewing is good from all angles.. Some TV's the picture is not very good from the side, like not being able to view the screen at all, or the colors being really off.. This screen does not have any of those problems..\n\nI think it would have been nice if there was more than 4 HDMI ports.. Me, surveillance system, Roku, Blu-ray player... That is 3 already.. Add in game systems, etc, and you can easily go up to over 4.. Especially when you consider that they took away all RCA, VGA, etc plugs.. You would think that they could put more HDMI on it..\n\nI did notice that you can not use 2 HDMI ports at the same time.. What I mean by this is.. They have a split screen option, or picture in picture.. I have my surveillance system on one HDMI port, and my Blu-ray player on another.. If I tried to watch a Blu-ray while having the cameras going on the PIP, the screen and sound for the Blu-ray just go blank, but the surveillance will work fine.. But if I have OTA or Samsung+ TV going on the first screen, it will plat the Blu-ray or surveillance on the second picture or screen with no problem.. So using PIP is very limited..\n\nUpon using it, to get to the Samsung menu, it is different between OTA TV and Samsung Plus internet channels.. You can get to the channel list by pressing straight down on the up/down button on the remote, no matter what channel you are watching.. But, you have to change the channel to one of the 1000+ channels to get to the Samsung plus menu.. Once you get to one of those internet channels, just hit the down button on the round button to get to this menu, and it will come up with \"Live\" or \"Discover\", and then hit down again.. Live will bring you to the same menu that you get by pressing straight down on the channel up/down button.. But if you move it over to Discover, it gives you a list of free movies and stuff that you can watch..\n\nThey should have this integrated so that you get this menu with all OTA channels along with the internet ones, just like how they have them both integrated into the menu list..\n\nOn the home screen, they automatically put anything new you add to the app list to the end of the line.. To move these icons to the front of the line, you have to hold the round button down on the remote for a couple of seconds.. It took me a little time to figure this out because I kept trying to go into the area that says \"apps\" to try and change the order.. I did not find anything in there about how to move the menu app icons around.. It would have been nice if at least, at first boot up, they gave you a little pop up menu top tell you this, or something.. Maybe have a section in the \"Apps\" area to move the icons order would have been OK too.. But nothing on either end made me waist a lot of time tying to figure out how to move the icons so what I wanted, the newly added ones, were not at the end of the line, but at the front.\n\nOn the internet samsung plus channels (1000+ channels), there is no way to tell what resolution that anything is in.. On the OTA channels, if you hit the round button it will tell you if it is SD or HD, and if you hold that same button down for a couple of seconds, it will tell you about the show and also tell you what resolution it is in.. 480i is usual for SD and either 720P or 1080i for HD.. But there is nothing for the 1000+ channels.. Why no consistency? Just to note.. Here, there is no OTA TV channels over 1080, so for just free OTA, if that is all you are watching, you probably will not notice any difference between a standard HD TV and a 4k TV.\n\nI have not used the voice part at all, so no comment there. I also had did some changes, like to have it automatically start where I last left off..\n\nOverall, it is a very nice TV, but it does have its little things that could be made better.. With the problem of the screen going on in just one month, and now knowing that this might be a constant, every so often problem, I am dropping the rating down to 3 stars for this reason."

Modia arranged a pickup with sufficient manpower to handle the TV.\nWe did wind up buying the TV again. The picture is stunning compared to the previous DLP TV we had.

Plugged it in before doing anything else and the power indicator turns red so the TV has power, but no picture would display on the screen and it would stay black/blank. I tried everything in the book, unplugging appliances, plugging it in a new outlet, tested the original outlet where the TV would go, used an extension cord, tried all the troubleshooting steps, checking the circuit breakers, you name it. Super frustrating waiting a week and planning a time to be home to sign for the TV just for it to not work 1 hour of it arriving to my home. Sat on the phone with amazon for 47 minutes to be put on hold for 40 of those minutes and then get hung up on. I call a second time and again, I get put on hold for 32 minutes and then finally get routed to a person that was able to help me. The replacement will take another week to get here so I’ll update this review if the next TV works."

The first tv we received had an extremely damaged screen. We plugged it in, it came on, and the screen looked shattered once turned on. We couldn’t see anything. You couldn’t see this until the tv was turned on as the actual physical screen looked perfect. Something was wrong inside. We had to repackage the huge tv and take it to the UPS store to return it. Had a replacement sent. We plugged this one in first and thankfully it came on perfectly. This is the largest tv we have ever owned, and it’s amazing how we can see details we never could before on our smaller tv. While it’s not the largest tv, it’s quite large for us. Plenty large. Makes things easier to see for my nearsighted eyes. Very pleased so far. Easy to add all of our streaming apps. It keeps asking us to connect to our wifi, and our old tv never did that, so hopefully that won’t be an ongoing issue. Overall, this is a super nice tv!"

I expected this TV to have better picture quality since technology has improved since, but was disappointed. The default colors were quite light and I had to play around with the color/picture controls manually to make them better. Brightness was also too high by default.\n\nUnless you sign up for a Samsung account, calibration capabilities with a mobile phone are not available. So finally I signed up for a Samsung account and then tried to calibrate with an S23 mobile phone. The result was a better picture, but not as good as the older plasma one.\n\nOf course there are quite a number of other features that comes with the TV, like apps, webcam addition, using your mobile phone camera, fireTV remote emulation, 4K streaming, embedded manuals and such... These are appreciated, but the primary use case is picture quality, where it did not quite meet the THX Cinema quality of the earlier plasma model."

          "review": "The TV is great.\n\nI paired it with the Sanus tilt mount, but dont make the same mistake I did and assume the mounting screws are centered vertically on the TV. I think they are offset by 3 inches, which by the grace of god still allowed me to mount this monster with millimeters of clearance.\n\nAlso for the Sanus mount I ended up having to use the 25mm M8 screws with a 5mm stand off as well as the included washer. So dont assume the 16mm M8 screws in the Sanus kit will fit, they were too short for me.\n\nSamsung is a solid brand with app features to boot. If you dont care about built in app support, I suppose you could go even cheaper with the TCL 98\" but for the extra grand it was worth it to me to get Samsung. I was between this and the Sony 100\" which gets you 2 inches extra diagonal and Dolby Vision but it was also 3k more. Wasnt worth it to me.\n\nIf i were to splurge I'd go for the QN 90A 98\" by Samsung. Unlimited cash I'd go with the 110\" LG OLED.\n\nThe box is enormous. I had to unpack and get a friend to safely get it into the basement after removing the hand rails. So be mindful of delivery because if you're moving this to anywhere beyond a direct entryway, you may find yourself stuck.\n\nThe picture is what you would expect from an LED. There's a considerable difference with blooming/bleed in high contrast scenes, but I'm comparing to LG OLED, which is insanely better but also much more costly. Also the OLED suffers from screen burn. I have a roughly 7 year old LG 65\" OLED that's been performing wonderfully to this day but now is showing signs of wear on images with a noticable split down the middle on darker images.\n\nOver all Im happy with my purchase. If you have the extra cash go with the QN, otherwise this is a solis contender."

          "review": "Samsung has always been one of the leading names in the electronics industry, and their latest offering, the Samsung 55-Inch Class QLED 4K Q80C Series modrl, is no exception. This television is an exceptional piece of technology, and I was lucky enough to get my hands on one to review. Not only is it packed with top-of-the-line features, but it also manages to be incredibly beautiful. In this review, I’ll be taking a closer look at the Samsung Q80C and telling you all about its features and the clever way they’ve been implemented.\n\n//Design:\n\nLet’s start with the design. The Samsung Q80C is an absolute stunner. It has a sleek, modern design that would look great in any living room. The television is very slim, and the bezels are almost nonexistent. This means that you get an almost edge-to-edge display, which is perfect for a more immersive viewing experience.\n\nBut the best part about the design is the way it’s been implemented with the Q80C’s Smart TV features. The television’s design is so sleek and seamless that it feels like the entire TV is one big Smart Hub. The Q80C’s Smart TV features are so intuitive that you’ll never want to go back to a regular remote. The remote is even designed to look like a gaming controller, which is a hilarious nod to the fact that this TV is great for gaming.\n\n//Display:\n\nMoving on to the display, the Samsung Q80C features a 55-inch QLED display with a resolution of 4K. This means that you’re getting an incredibly sharp and detailed picture. The colors are vivid and bright, and the blacks are deep and dark. The QLED technology also means that the TV has a very high contrast ratio, which is great for watching movies and TV shows with a lot of dark scenes.\n\nBut what really sets the Samsung Q80C apart from other televisions is the Quantum HDR+ technology. This technology uses a combination of HDR10+ and HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) to produce an even wider range of colors and brightness levels. This means that the TV is able to display more realistic colors, which is especially noticeable in nature documentaries and other shows with lots of bright colors. And once again, Samsung manages to inject humor into their technology by making the Q80C’s picture so vivid that it’s almost like you’re actually there.\n\n//Sound:\n\nThe sound on the Samsung Q80C is also something special. The TV features Dolby Atmos Object Tracking Sound Lite, which is a mouthful to say but basically means that the TV is able to produce a more immersive and directional sound experience. This is especially noticeable when watching action movies or playing video games, where the sound can help you locate enemies or explosions.\n\nBut Samsung doesn’t stop there. They’ve also included Q-Symphony 3.0, which is a feature that allows the TV to work in sync with your soundbar or home theater system. This means that you can get even better sound quality without having to worry about syncing issues.\n\nAnd once again, Samsung is injecting so much data into their technology by making the Q80C’s sound so immersive that it’s like you’re actually in the action. But they take it a step further by including a feature called “Object Tracking Sound Lite,” which sounds like something out of a science fiction movie.\n\n//Gaming:\n\nThe Samsung Q80C is also great for gaming. The TV has a Game Mode, which reduces input lag and optimizes the picture fora better gaming experience. This means that you can play your favorite games without having to worry about lag or any visual issues.\n\nBut what really sets the Samsung Q80C apart for gamers is the Gaming Hub. This feature is a one-stop-shop for all your gaming needs. It allows you to access all your favorite gaming apps, like Twitch and Discord, without having to switch inputs or navigate through menus. This is a game-changer for gamers, as it makes it much easier to access everything you need to get your gaming fix.\n\nThe Q80C’s Game Mode so good that you’ll forget you’re not actually in the game. And the Gaming Hub is so convenient that you’ll never want to leave your couch.\n\n//Smart TV Features:\n\nThe Samsung Q80C is also packed with Smart TV features. It has Alexa built-in, which means that you can control your TV with your voice. This is especially convenient for when you can’t find the remote or when you’re too lazy to get up off the couch.\n\nBut Samsung takes it a step further by making the Q80C’s Smart TV features so intuitive that you’ll feel like you’re living in the future. The TV’s Smart Hub allows you to easily access all your favorite apps and streaming services, and the OneRemote allows you to control all your devices with just one remote. Samsung’s Smart TV features are so seamless that you’ll never want to go back to a regular TV.\n\n//Conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, the Samsung 55-Inch Class QLED 4K Q80C Series, is an exceptional piece of technology. It’s packed with top-of-the-line features that make it great for everything from watching movies to playing video games. But what really sets the Q80C apart is the way that Samsung injects humor into their technology. They manage to make their features both informative and funny, which makes using the TV a joy.\n\nThe Q80C’s design is sleek and modern, and the display is incredibly sharp and vivid. The sound is immersive and directional, and the TV is great for gaming. The Smart TV features are intuitive and convenient, and Alexa built-in makes controlling your TV a breeze.\n\n//Overall, the Q80C Series is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a great TV. It's got everything you could want in a TV, and it's sure to impress your friends and family.\n\n----------------\n\nIf you made it this far through my review, then here's a funny story about the TV:\n\nI was watching a movie on the TV, and I got so engrossed in the story that I forgot to turn on the subtitles. I didn't realize this until I heard a character say something that I didn't understand. I looked down at the TV and saw that the subtitles were turned off. I laughed out loud and said to myself, \"I'm such an idiot.\"\n\nI turned on the subtitles and continued watching the movie. I was able to understand everything that was being said, and I enjoyed the movie even more.\n\nMoral of the story: Always turn on the subtitles when you're watching a movie on a TV. It will make your viewing experience much more enjoyable.. If you’re in the market for a new TV, I highly recommend checking out the Samsung Q80C, a television that's so packed with features, it's like a Swiss army knife for your entertainment center. You won’t be disappointed."

          "rating": "3.0",
          "review": "Update:\n\nThe TV was delivered on March 27th, and on April 30th I noticed that the brightness of the screen started flickering while watching a BluRay.. Then, I went to bed and turned the TV off, got up the next morning and found that the TV would turn on, but I would get no screen.. I only use the TV about 12 hours a day at the most.. Some days, it may not even get turned on.. If I shined a flashlight onto the screen, I could make out the picture in the background, but it was like the light in the back of the TV went out.. I ended up getting help and they had me hold the power button down on the remote for a few seconds until the TV rebooted.. After I did, which took something like 5 or so seconds, the TV did reboot and is now working fine.. I guess it is because it gets a build up of static on the inside, and rebooting it discharges all that static.. I have never had a TV do this before, so this is a first for me.. If you have this problem too, then try this before you do anything else..\n\nOriginal post: (with a few minor updates)\n\nMy first complaint, which I do not understand why it happened, but I tried to change channels once and when I did, it just came up with a big box in the middle of the screen that said scanning or something.. I had been using it for a while, so this was not just installed when it did this.. But it did this a couple of times in a row.. I went to the home menu screen, and then back, and it has never done that again.. Glitch?? I think I was on OTA TV at the time.. I never had the problem again after that (a month later)..\n\nThe picture viewing is good from all angles.. Some TV's the picture is not very good from the side, like not being able to view the screen at all, or the colors being really off.. This screen does not have any of those problems..\n\nI think it would have been nice if there was more than 4 HDMI ports.. Me, surveillance system, Roku, Blu-ray player... That is 3 already.. Add in game systems, etc, and you can easily go up to over 4.. Especially when you consider that they took away all RCA, VGA, etc plugs.. You would think that they could put more HDMI on it..\n\nI did notice that you can not use 2 HDMI ports at the same time.. What I mean by this is.. They have a split screen option, or picture in picture.. I have my surveillance system on one HDMI port, and my Blu-ray player on another.. If I tried to watch a Blu-ray while having the cameras going on the PIP, the screen and sound for the Blu-ray just go blank, but the surveillance will work fine.. But if I have OTA or Samsung+ TV going on the first screen, it will plat the Blu-ray or surveillance on the second picture or screen with no problem.. So using PIP is very limited..\n\nUpon using it, to get to the Samsung menu, it is different between OTA TV and Samsung Plus internet channels.. You can get to the channel list by pressing straight down on the up/down button on the remote, no matter what channel you are watching.. But, you have to change the channel to one of the 1000+ channels to get to the Samsung plus menu.. Once you get to one of those internet channels, just hit the down button on the round button to get to this menu, and it will come up with \"Live\" or \"Discover\", and then hit down again.. Live will bring you to the same menu that you get by pressing straight down on the channel up/down button.. But if you move it over to Discover, it gives you a list of free movies and stuff that you can watch..\n\nThey should have this integrated so that you get this menu with all OTA channels along with the internet ones, just like how they have them both integrated into the menu list..\n\nOn the home screen, they automatically put anything new you add to the app list to the end of the line.. To move these icons to the front of the line, you have to hold the round button down on the remote for a couple of seconds.. It took me a little time to figure this out because I kept trying to go into the area that says \"apps\" to try and change the order.. I did not find anything in there about how to move the menu app icons around.. It would have been nice if at least, at first boot up, they gave you a little pop up menu top tell you this, or something.. Maybe have a section in the \"Apps\" area to move the icons order would have been OK too.. But nothing on either end made me waist a lot of time tying to figure out how to move the icons so what I wanted, the newly added ones, were not at the end of the line, but at the front.\n\nOn the internet samsung plus channels (1000+ channels), there is no way to tell what resolution that anything is in.. On the OTA channels, if you hit the round button it will tell you if it is SD or HD, and if you hold that same button down for a couple of seconds, it will tell you about the show and also tell you what resolution it is in.. 480i is usual for SD and either 720P or 1080i for HD.. But there is nothing for the 1000+ channels.. Why no consistency? Just to note.. Here, there is no OTA TV channels over 1080, so for just free OTA, if that is all you are watching, you probably will not notice any difference between a standard HD TV and a 4k TV.\n\nI have not used the voice part at all, so no comment there. I also had did some changes, like to have it automatically start where I last left off..\n\nOverall, it is a very nice TV, but it does have its little things that could be made better.. With the problem of the screen going on in just one month, and now knowing that this might be a constant, every so often problem, I am dropping the rating down to 3 stars for this reason."

Modia arranged a pickup with sufficient manpower to handle the TV.\nWe did wind up buying the TV again. The picture is stunning compared to the previous DLP TV we had. We would definitely buy again from Modia. They provided awesome service every step of the way."

I tried everything in the book, unplugging appliances, plugging it in a new outlet, tested the original outlet where the TV would go, used an extension cord, tried all the troubleshooting steps, checking the circuit breakers, you name it. Super frustrating waiting a week and planning a time to be home to sign for the TV just for it to not work 1 hour of it arriving to my home. Sat on the phone with amazon for 47 minutes to be put on hold for 40 of those minutes and then get hung up on. I call a second time and again, I get put on hold for 32 minutes and then finally get routed to a person that was able to help me. The replacement will take another week to get here so I’ll update this review if the next TV works."

The first tv we received had an extremely damaged screen. We plugged it in, it came on, and the screen looked shattered once turned on. We couldn’t see anything. You couldn’t see this until the tv was turned on as the actual physical screen looked perfect. Something was wrong inside. We had to repackage the huge tv and take it to the UPS store to return it. Had a replacement sent. We plugged this one in first and thankfully it came on perfectly. This is the largest tv we have ever owned, and it’s amazing how we can see details we never could before on our smaller tv. While it’s not the largest tv, it’s quite large for us. Plenty large. Makes things easier to see for my nearsighted eyes. Very pleased so far. Easy to add all of our streaming apps. It keeps asking us to connect to our wifi, and our old tv never did that, so hopefully that won’t be an ongoing issue. Overall, this is a super nice tv!"

I expected this TV to have better picture quality since technology has improved since, but was disappointed. The default colors were quite light and I had to play around with the color/picture controls manually to make them better. Brightness was also too high by default.\n\nUnless you sign up for a Samsung account, calibration capabilities with a mobile phone are not available. So finally I signed up for a Samsung account and then tried to calibrate with an S23 mobile phone. The result was a better picture, but not as good as the older plasma one.\n\nOf course there are quite a number of other features that comes with the TV, like apps, webcam addition, using your mobile phone camera, fireTV remote emulation, 4K streaming, embedded manuals and such... These are appreciated, but the primary use case is picture quality, where it did not quite meet the THX Cinema quality of the earlier plasma model."

I even tried some tricks found on YouTube and it didn’t work. Spending to much time trying to get the screen to full-size gives this product a 4. This day and age I should not be dealing with this menu option this long and hard."

          "review": "The TV is great.\n\nI paired it with the Sanus tilt mount, but dont make the same mistake I did and assume the mounting screws are centered vertically on the TV. I think they are offset by 3 inches, which by the grace of god still allowed me to mount this monster with millimeters of clearance.\n\nAlso for the Sanus mount I ended up having to use the 25mm M8 screws with a 5mm stand off as well as the included washer. So dont assume the 16mm M8 screws in the Sanus kit will fit, they were too short for me.\n\nSamsung is a solid brand with app features to boot. If you dont care about built in app support, I suppose you could go even cheaper with the TCL 98\" but for the extra grand it was worth it to me to get Samsung. I was between this and the Sony 100\" which gets you 2 inches extra diagonal and Dolby Vision but it was also 3k more. Wasnt worth it to me.\n\nIf i were to splurge I'd go for the QN 90A 98\" by Samsung. Unlimited cash I'd go with the 110\" LG OLED.\n\nThe box is enormous. I had to unpack and get a friend to safely get it into the basement after removing the hand rails. So be mindful of delivery because if you're moving this to anywhere beyond a direct entryway, you may find yourself stuck.\n\nThe picture is what you would expect from an LED. There's a considerable difference with blooming/bleed in high contrast scenes, but I'm comparing to LG OLED, which is insanely better but also much more costly. Also the OLED suffers from screen burn. I have a roughly 7 year old LG 65\" OLED that's been performing wonderfully to this day but now is showing signs of wear on images with a noticable split down the middle on darker images.\n\nOver all Im happy with my purchase. If you have the extra cash go with the QN, otherwise this is a solis contender."

          "review": "Samsung has always been one of the leading names in the electronics industry, and their latest offering, the Samsung 55-Inch Class QLED 4K Q80C Series modrl, is no exception. This television is an exceptional piece of technology, and I was lucky enough to get my hands on one to review. Not only is it packed with top-of-the-line features, but it also manages to be incredibly beautiful. In this review, I’ll be taking a closer look at the Samsung Q80C and telling you all about its features and the clever way they’ve been implemented.\n\n//Design:\n\nLet’s start with the design. The Samsung Q80C is an absolute stunner. It has a sleek, modern design that would look great in any living room. The television is very slim, and the bezels are almost nonexistent. This means that you get an almost edge-to-edge display, which is perfect for a more immersive viewing experience.\n\nBut the best part about the design is the way it’s been implemented with the Q80C’s Smart TV features. The television’s design is so sleek and seamless that it feels like the entire TV is one big Smart Hub. The Q80C’s Smart TV features are so intuitive that you’ll never want to go back to a regular remote. The remote is even designed to look like a gaming controller, which is a hilarious nod to the fact that this TV is great for gaming.\n\n//Display:\n\nMoving on to the display, the Samsung Q80C features a 55-inch QLED display with a resolution of 4K. This means that you’re getting an incredibly sharp and detailed picture. The colors are vivid and bright, and the blacks are deep and dark. The QLED technology also means that the TV has a very high contrast ratio, which is great for watching movies and TV shows with a lot of dark scenes.\n\nBut what really sets the Samsung Q80C apart from other televisions is the Quantum HDR+ technology. This technology uses a combination of HDR10+ and HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) to produce an even wider range of colors and brightness levels. This means that the TV is able to display more realistic colors, which is especially noticeable in nature documentaries and other shows with lots of bright colors. And once again, Samsung manages to inject humor into their technology by making the Q80C’s picture so vivid that it’s almost like you’re actually there.\n\n//Sound:\n\nThe sound on the Samsung Q80C is also something special. The TV features Dolby Atmos Object Tracking Sound Lite, which is a mouthful to say but basically means that the TV is able to produce a more immersive and directional sound experience. This is especially noticeable when watching action movies or playing video games, where the sound can help you locate enemies or explosions.\n\nBut Samsung doesn’t stop there. They’ve also included Q-Symphony 3.0, which is a feature that allows the TV to work in sync with your soundbar or home theater system. This means that you can get even better sound quality without having to worry about syncing issues.\n\nAnd once again, Samsung is injecting so much data into their technology by making the Q80C’s sound so immersive that it’s like you’re actually in the action. But they take it a step further by including a feature called “Object Tracking Sound Lite,” which sounds like something out of a science fiction movie.\n\n//Gaming:\n\nThe Samsung Q80C is also great for gaming. The TV has a Game Mode, which reduces input lag and optimizes the picture fora better gaming experience. This means that you can play your favorite games without having to worry about lag or any visual issues.\n\nBut what really sets the Samsung Q80C apart for gamers is the Gaming Hub. This feature is a one-stop-shop for all your gaming needs. It allows you to access all your favorite gaming apps, like Twitch and Discord, without having to switch inputs or navigate through menus. This is a game-changer for gamers, as it makes it much easier to access everything you need to get your gaming fix.\n\nThe Q80C’s Game Mode so good that you’ll forget you’re not actually in the game. And the Gaming Hub is so convenient that you’ll never want to leave your couch.\n\n//Smart TV Features:\n\nThe Samsung Q80C is also packed with Smart TV features. It has Alexa built-in, which means that you can control your TV with your voice. This is especially convenient for when you can’t find the remote or when you’re too lazy to get up off the couch.\n\nBut Samsung takes it a step further by making the Q80C’s Smart TV features so intuitive that you’ll feel like you’re living in the future. The TV’s Smart Hub allows you to easily access all your favorite apps and streaming services, and the OneRemote allows you to control all your devices with just one remote. Samsung’s Smart TV features are so seamless that you’ll never want to go back to a regular TV.\n\n//Conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, the Samsung 55-Inch Class QLED 4K Q80C Series, is an exceptional piece of technology. It’s packed with top-of-the-line features that make it great for everything from watching movies to playing video games. But what really sets the Q80C apart is the way that Samsung injects humor into their technology. They manage to make their features both informative and funny, which makes using the TV a joy.\n\nThe Q80C’s design is sleek and modern, and the display is incredibly sharp and vivid. The sound is immersive and directional, and the TV is great for gaming. The Smart TV features are intuitive and convenient, and Alexa built-in makes controlling your TV a breeze.\n\n//Overall, the Q80C Series is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a great TV. It's got everything you could want in a TV, and it's sure to impress your friends and family.\n\n----------------\n\nIf you made it this far through my review, then here's a funny story about the TV:\n\nI was watching a movie on the TV, and I got so engrossed in the story that I forgot to turn on the subtitles. I didn't realize this until I heard a character say something that I didn't understand. I looked down at the TV and saw that the subtitles were turned off. I laughed out loud and said to myself, \"I'm such an idiot.\"\n\nI turned on the subtitles and continued watching the movie. I was able to understand everything that was being said, and I enjoyed the movie even more.\n\nMoral of the story: Always turn on the subtitles when you're watching a movie on a TV. It will make your viewing experience much more enjoyable.. If you’re in the market for a new TV, I highly recommend checking out the Samsung Q80C, a television that's so packed with features, it's like a Swiss army knife for your entertainment center. You won’t be disappointed."

          "rating": "3.0",
          "review": "Update:\n\nThe TV was delivered on March 27th, and on April 30th I noticed that the brightness of the screen started flickering while watching a BluRay.. Then, I went to bed and turned the TV off, got up the next morning and found that the TV would turn on, but I would get no screen.. I only use the TV about 12 hours a day at the most.. Some days, it may not even get turned on.. If I shined a flashlight onto the screen, I could make out the picture in the background, but it was like the light in the back of the TV went out.. I ended up getting help and they had me hold the power button down on the remote for a few seconds until the TV rebooted.. After I did, which took something like 5 or so seconds, the TV did reboot and is now working fine.. I guess it is because it gets a build up of static on the inside, and rebooting it discharges all that static.. I have never had a TV do this before, so this is a first for me.. If you have this problem too, then try this before you do anything else..\n\nOriginal post: (with a few minor updates)\n\nMy first complaint, which I do not understand why it happened, but I tried to change channels once and when I did, it just came up with a big box in the middle of the screen that said scanning or something.. I had been using it for a while, so this was not just installed when it did this.. But it did this a couple of times in a row.. I went to the home menu screen, and then back, and it has never done that again.. Glitch?? I think I was on OTA TV at the time.. I never had the problem again after that (a month later)..\n\nThe picture viewing is good from all angles.. Some TV's the picture is not very good from the side, like not being able to view the screen at all, or the colors being really off.. This screen does not have any of those problems..\n\nI think it would have been nice if there was more than 4 HDMI ports.. Me, surveillance system, Roku, Blu-ray player... That is 3 already.. Add in game systems, etc, and you can easily go up to over 4.. Especially when you consider that they took away all RCA, VGA, etc plugs.. You would think that they could put more HDMI on it..\n\nI did notice that you can not use 2 HDMI ports at the same time.. What I mean by this is.. They have a split screen option, or picture in picture.. I have my surveillance system on one HDMI port, and my Blu-ray player on another.. If I tried to watch a Blu-ray while having the cameras going on the PIP, the screen and sound for the Blu-ray just go blank, but the surveillance will work fine.. But if I have OTA or Samsung+ TV going on the first screen, it will plat the Blu-ray or surveillance on the second picture or screen with no problem.. So using PIP is very limited..\n\nUpon using it, to get to the Samsung menu, it is different between OTA TV and Samsung Plus internet channels.. You can get to the channel list by pressing straight down on the up/down button on the remote, no matter what channel you are watching.. But, you have to change the channel to one of the 1000+ channels to get to the Samsung plus menu.. Once you get to one of those internet channels, just hit the down button on the round button to get to this menu, and it will come up with \"Live\" or \"Discover\", and then hit down again.. Live will bring you to the same menu that you get by pressing straight down on the channel up/down button.. But if you move it over to Discover, it gives you a list of free movies and stuff that you can watch..\n\nThey should have this integrated so that you get this menu with all OTA channels along with the internet ones, just like how they have them both integrated into the menu list..\n\nOn the home screen, they automatically put anything new you add to the app list to the end of the line.. To move these icons to the front of the line, you have to hold the round button down on the remote for a couple of seconds.. It took me a little time to figure this out because I kept trying to go into the area that says \"apps\" to try and change the order.. I did not find anything in there about how to move the menu app icons around.. It would have been nice if at least, at first boot up, they gave you a little pop up menu top tell you this, or something.. Maybe have a section in the \"Apps\" area to move the icons order would have been OK too.. But nothing on either end made me waist a lot of time tying to figure out how to move the icons so what I wanted, the newly added ones, were not at the end of the line, but at the front.\n\nOn the internet samsung plus channels (1000+ channels), there is no way to tell what resolution that anything is in.. On the OTA channels, if you hit the round button it will tell you if it is SD or HD, and if you hold that same button down for a couple of seconds, it will tell you about the show and also tell you what resolution it is in.. 480i is usual for SD and either 720P or 1080i for HD.. But there is nothing for the 1000+ channels.. Why no consistency? Just to note.. Here, there is no OTA TV channels over 1080, so for just free OTA, if that is all you are watching, you probably will not notice any difference between a standard HD TV and a 4k TV.\n\nI have not used the voice part at all, so no comment there. I also had did some changes, like to have it automatically start where I last left off..\n\nOverall, it is a very nice TV, but it does have its little things that could be made better.. With the problem of the screen going on in just one month, and now knowing that this might be a constant, every so often problem, I am dropping the rating down to 3 stars for this reason."

I tried everything in the book, unplugging appliances, plugging it in a new outlet, tested the original outlet where the TV would go, used an extension cord, tried all the troubleshooting steps, checking the circuit breakers, you name it. Super frustrating waiting a week and planning a time to be home to sign for the TV just for it to not work 1 hour of it arriving to my home. Sat on the phone with amazon for 47 minutes to be put on hold for 40 of those minutes and then get hung up on. I call a second time and again, I get put on hold for 32 minutes and then finally get routed to a person that was able to help me. The replacement will take another week to get here so I’ll update this review if the next TV works."

You couldn’t see this until the tv was turned on as the actual physical screen looked perfect. Something was wrong inside. We had to repackage the huge tv and take it to the UPS store to return it. Had a replacement sent. We plugged this one in first and thankfully it came on perfectly. This is the largest tv we have ever owned, and it’s amazing how we can see details we never could before on our smaller tv. While it’s not the largest tv, it’s quite large for us. Plenty large. Makes things easier to see for my nearsighted eyes. Very pleased so far. Easy to add all of our streaming apps. It keeps asking us to connect to our wifi, and our old tv never did that, so hopefully that won’t be an ongoing issue. Overall, this is a super nice tv!"

          "review": "I was replacing a 12 year old 65\" LG Plasma TV which had THX certified Cinema Mode. I expected this TV to have better picture quality since technology has improved since, but was disappointed. The default colors were quite light and I had to play around with the color/picture controls manually to make them better. Brightness was also too high by default.\n\nUnless you sign up for a Samsung account, calibration capabilities with a mobile phone are not available. So finally I signed up for a Samsung account and then tried to calibrate with an S23 mobile phone. The result was a better picture, but not as good as the older plasma one.\n\nOf course there are quite a number of other features that comes with the TV, like apps, webcam addition, using your mobile phone camera, fireTV remote emulation, 4K streaming, embedded manuals and such... These are appreciated, but the primary use case is picture quality, where it did not quite meet the THX Cinema quality of the earlier plasma model."

          "rating": "4.0",
          "review": "The TV is great.\n\nI paired it with the Sanus tilt mount, but dont make the same mistake I did and assume the mounting screws are centered vertically on the TV. I think they are offset by 3 inches, which by the grace of god still allowed me to mount this monster with millimeters of clearance.\n\nAlso for the Sanus mount I ended up having to use the 25mm M8 screws with a 5mm stand off as well as the included washer. So dont assume the 16mm M8 screws in the Sanus kit will fit, they were too short for me.\n\nSamsung is a solid brand with app features to boot. If you dont care about built in app support, I suppose you could go even cheaper with the TCL 98\" but for the extra grand it was worth it to me to get Samsung. I was between this and the Sony 100\" which gets you 2 inches extra diagonal and Dolby Vision but it was also 3k more. Wasnt worth it to me.\n\nIf i were to splurge I'd go for the QN 90A 98\" by Samsung. Unlimited cash I'd go with the 110\" LG OLED.\n\nThe box is enormous. I had to unpack and get a friend to safely get it into the basement after removing the hand rails. So be mindful of delivery because if you're moving this to anywhere beyond a direct entryway, you may find yourself stuck.\n\nThe picture is what you would expect from an LED. There's a considerable difference with blooming/bleed in high contrast scenes, but I'm comparing to LG OLED, which is insanely better but also much more costly. Also the OLED suffers from screen burn. I have a roughly 7 year old LG 65\" OLED that's been performing wonderfully to this day but now is showing signs of wear on images with a noticable split down the middle on darker images.\n\nOver all Im happy with my purchase. If you have the extra cash go with the QN, otherwise this is a solis contender."

          "review": "Samsung has always been one of the leading names in the electronics industry, and their latest offering, the Samsung 55-Inch Class QLED 4K Q80C Series modrl, is no exception. This television is an exceptional piece of technology, and I was lucky enough to get my hands on one to review. Not only is it packed with top-of-the-line features, but it also manages to be incredibly beautiful. In this review, I’ll be taking a closer look at the Samsung Q80C and telling you all about its features and the clever way they’ve been implemented.\n\n//Design:\n\nLet’s start with the design. The Samsung Q80C is an absolute stunner. It has a sleek, modern design that would look great in any living room. The television is very slim, and the bezels are almost nonexistent. This means that you get an almost edge-to-edge display, which is perfect for a more immersive viewing experience.\n\nBut the best part about the design is the way it’s been implemented with the Q80C’s Smart TV features. The television’s design is so sleek and seamless that it feels like the entire TV is one big Smart Hub. The Q80C’s Smart TV features are so intuitive that you’ll never want to go back to a regular remote. The remote is even designed to look like a gaming controller, which is a hilarious nod to the fact that this TV is great for gaming.\n\n//Display:\n\nMoving on to the display, the Samsung Q80C features a 55-inch QLED display with a resolution of 4K. This means that you’re getting an incredibly sharp and detailed picture. The colors are vivid and bright, and the blacks are deep and dark. The QLED technology also means that the TV has a very high contrast ratio, which is great for watching movies and TV shows with a lot of dark scenes.\n\nBut what really sets the Samsung Q80C apart from other televisions is the Quantum HDR+ technology. This technology uses a combination of HDR10+ and HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) to produce an even wider range of colors and brightness levels. This means that the TV is able to display more realistic colors, which is especially noticeable in nature documentaries and other shows with lots of bright colors. And once again, Samsung manages to inject humor into their technology by making the Q80C’s picture so vivid that it’s almost like you’re actually there.\n\n//Sound:\n\nThe sound on the Samsung Q80C is also something special. The TV features Dolby Atmos Object Tracking Sound Lite, which is a mouthful to say but basically means that the TV is able to produce a more immersive and directional sound experience. This is especially noticeable when watching action movies or playing video games, where the sound can help you locate enemies or explosions.\n\nBut Samsung doesn’t stop there. They’ve also included Q-Symphony 3.0, which is a feature that allows the TV to work in sync with your soundbar or home theater system. This means that you can get even better sound quality without having to worry about syncing issues.\n\nAnd once again, Samsung is injecting so much data into their technology by making the Q80C’s sound so immersive that it’s like you’re actually in the action. But they take it a step further by including a feature called “Object Tracking Sound Lite,” which sounds like something out of a science fiction movie.\n\n//Gaming:\n\nThe Samsung Q80C is also great for gaming. The TV has a Game Mode, which reduces input lag and optimizes the picture fora better gaming experience. This means that you can play your favorite games without having to worry about lag or any visual issues.\n\nBut what really sets the Samsung Q80C apart for gamers is the Gaming Hub. This feature is a one-stop-shop for all your gaming needs. It allows you to access all your favorite gaming apps, like Twitch and Discord, without having to switch inputs or navigate through menus. This is a game-changer for gamers, as it makes it much easier to access everything you need to get your gaming fix.\n\nThe Q80C’s Game Mode so good that you’ll forget you’re not actually in the game. And the Gaming Hub is so convenient that you’ll never want to leave your couch.\n\n//Smart TV Features:\n\nThe Samsung Q80C is also packed with Smart TV features. It has Alexa built-in, which means that you can control your TV with your voice. This is especially convenient for when you can’t find the remote or when you’re too lazy to get up off the couch.\n\nBut Samsung takes it a step further by making the Q80C’s Smart TV features so intuitive that you’ll feel like you’re living in the future. The TV’s Smart Hub allows you to easily access all your favorite apps and streaming services, and the OneRemote allows you to control all your devices with just one remote. Samsung’s Smart TV features are so seamless that you’ll never want to go back to a regular TV.\n\n//Conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, the Samsung 55-Inch Class QLED 4K Q80C Series, is an exceptional piece of technology. It’s packed with top-of-the-line features that make it great for everything from watching movies to playing video games. But what really sets the Q80C apart is the way that Samsung injects humor into their technology. They manage to make their features both informative and funny, which makes using the TV a joy.\n\nThe Q80C’s design is sleek and modern, and the display is incredibly sharp and vivid. The sound is immersive and directional, and the TV is great for gaming. The Smart TV features are intuitive and convenient, and Alexa built-in makes controlling your TV a breeze.\n\n//Overall, the Q80C Series is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a great TV. It's got everything you could want in a TV, and it's sure to impress your friends and family.\n\n----------------\n\nIf you made it this far through my review, then here's a funny story about the TV:\n\nI was watching a movie on the TV, and I got so engrossed in the story that I forgot to turn on the subtitles. I didn't realize this until I heard a character say something that I didn't understand. I looked down at the TV and saw that the subtitles were turned off. I laughed out loud and said to myself, \"I'm such an idiot.\"\n\nI turned on the subtitles and continued watching the movie. I was able to understand everything that was being said, and I enjoyed the movie even more.\n\nMoral of the story: Always turn on the subtitles when you're watching a movie on a TV. It will make your viewing experience much more enjoyable.. If you’re in the market for a new TV, I highly recommend checking out the Samsung Q80C, a television that's so packed with features, it's like a Swiss army knife for your entertainment center. You won’t be disappointed."

          "review": "Update:\n\nThe TV was delivered on March 27th, and on April 30th I noticed that the brightness of the screen started flickering while watching a BluRay.. Then, I went to bed and turned the TV off, got up the next morning and found that the TV would turn on, but I would get no screen.. I only use the TV about 12 hours a day at the most.. Some days, it may not even get turned on.. If I shined a flashlight onto the screen, I could make out the picture in the background, but it was like the light in the back of the TV went out.. I ended up getting help and they had me hold the power button down on the remote for a few seconds until the TV rebooted.. After I did, which took something like 5 or so seconds, the TV did reboot and is now working fine.. I guess it is because it gets a build up of static on the inside, and rebooting it discharges all that static.. I have never had a TV do this before, so this is a first for me.. If you have this problem too, then try this before you do anything else..\n\nOriginal post: (with a few minor updates)\n\nMy first complaint, which I do not understand why it happened, but I tried to change channels once and when I did, it just came up with a big box in the middle of the screen that said scanning or something.. I had been using it for a while, so this was not just installed when it did this.. But it did this a couple of times in a row.. I went to the home menu screen, and then back, and it has never done that again.. Glitch?? I think I was on OTA TV at the time.. I never had the problem again after that (a month later)..\n\nThe picture viewing is good from all angles.. Some TV's the picture is not very good from the side, like not being able to view the screen at all, or the colors being really off.. This screen does not have any of those problems..\n\nI think it would have been nice if there was more than 4 HDMI ports.. Me, surveillance system, Roku, Blu-ray player... That is 3 already.. Add in game systems, etc, and you can easily go up to over 4.. Especially when you consider that they took away all RCA, VGA, etc plugs.. You would think that they could put more HDMI on it..\n\nI did notice that you can not use 2 HDMI ports at the same time.. What I mean by this is.. They have a split screen option, or picture in picture.. I have my surveillance system on one HDMI port, and my Blu-ray player on another.. If I tried to watch a Blu-ray while having the cameras going on the PIP, the screen and sound for the Blu-ray just go blank, but the surveillance will work fine.. But if I have OTA or Samsung+ TV going on the first screen, it will plat the Blu-ray or surveillance on the second picture or screen with no problem.. So using PIP is very limited..\n\nUpon using it, to get to the Samsung menu, it is different between OTA TV and Samsung Plus internet channels.. You can get to the channel list by pressing straight down on the up/down button on the remote, no matter what channel you are watching.. But, you have to change the channel to one of the 1000+ channels to get to the Samsung plus menu.. Once you get to one of those internet channels, just hit the down button on the round button to get to this menu, and it will come up with \"Live\" or \"Discover\", and then hit down again.. Live will bring you to the same menu that you get by pressing straight down on the channel up/down button.. But if you move it over to Discover, it gives you a list of free movies and stuff that you can watch..\n\nThey should have this integrated so that you get this menu with all OTA channels along with the internet ones, just like how they have them both integrated into the menu list..\n\nOn the home screen, they automatically put anything new you add to the app list to the end of the line.. To move these icons to the front of the line, you have to hold the round button down on the remote for a couple of seconds.. It took me a little time to figure this out because I kept trying to go into the area that says \"apps\" to try and change the order.. I did not find anything in there about how to move the menu app icons around.. It would have been nice if at least, at first boot up, they gave you a little pop up menu top tell you this, or something.. Maybe have a section in the \"Apps\" area to move the icons order would have been OK too.. But nothing on either end made me waist a lot of time tying to figure out how to move the icons so what I wanted, the newly added ones, were not at the end of the line, but at the front.\n\nOn the internet samsung plus channels (1000+ channels), there is no way to tell what resolution that anything is in.. On the OTA channels, if you hit the round button it will tell you if it is SD or HD, and if you hold that same button down for a couple of seconds, it will tell you about the show and also tell you what resolution it is in.. 480i is usual for SD and either 720P or 1080i for HD.. But there is nothing for the 1000+ channels.. Why no consistency? Just to note.. Here, there is no OTA TV channels over 1080, so for just free OTA, if that is all you are watching, you probably will not notice any difference between a standard HD TV and a 4k TV.\n\nI have not used the voice part at all, so no comment there. I also had did some changes, like to have it automatically start where I last left off..\n\nOverall, it is a very nice TV, but it does have its little things that could be made better.. With the problem of the screen going on in just one month, and now knowing that this might be a constant, every so often problem, I am dropping the rating down to 3 stars for this reason."

          "review": "Never bought a TV from Amazon before, but this was a decently pleasant experience. The first TV we ordered had some visual noise/blurring after 2 weeks of use. Called support and they sent a replacement right away and I only had to box the 1st one and send it back in. It's been over a month now with the replacement and it's a phenomenal experience. 120hz refresh rate is a game changer when viewing movies as images are able to be viewed as intended. Picture quality is amazing and very crisp. I don't care for the HDR as we live in an apt. that has some seriously superb naturally lighting that is very difficult to evade with extreme countermeasures. My wife and I have a rewatched so many movies and shows already as it's a new experience vs. a 60 hz refresh rate TV. Very happy with this purchase and hope it holds well for at least 3 years."

          "review": "I ordered this 65” Samsung as part of Amazons Prime Days sale. The TV is great. Very modern and thin with several HDMI ports for accessories. The picture is great and the set up was pretty easy. It didn’t take long to go through the wizard and add all my apps and streaming services. We use DirectTV streaming and the app works great along with all the others. We also purchased a Samsung soundbar with subwoofer and the set up with the TV was super easy and paired immediately. Only giving 4 stars because the delivery was terrible. You set up the delivery date after purchase and it was a week, not Prime. That would have been fine but on my date of delivery (which I needed to work at home for) they didn’t show up and they didn’t even notify me. The next day no communication either! They finally acknowledged they didn’t show up and my next delivery date was almost 10 days later. Took 3 weeks for a Prime delivery, clearly they were just trying to sell TVs but anyway, the product is good. Recommend the Samsung soundbar and sub as well."

          "rating": "1.0",
          "review": " I purchased the Samsung Q70C 85\" TV from SKG USA, drawn by the promise of 'Used - Like New' condition and the assurance of a full manufacturer's warranty. The claim was that the box had suffered minor damage while the TV remained in perfect condition. No box damaged was noted on arrival. However, within the first 30 days, my expectations were met with disappointment.\n\nDuring a dark room test, the TV, priced at $1700, revealed significant 'clouding' and 'banding' defects. These terms might sound technical, but they simply mean that the screen has uneven patches of brightness ('clouding') and visible lines across the display ('banding'), which are particularly noticeable in darker scenes. For a TV boasting QLED technology, known for its stellar picture quality, this is a surprising and unacceptable issue so early in its lifespan.\n\nDespite the TV's impressive color accuracy, smart features, and design, these screen uniformity flaws are a major letdown, suggesting a potential defect that undermines the value of this high-end model. It's disheartening to encounter such problems on a device that's barely a month old and sold as near-perfect.\n\nI am reaching out through this review in hopes that SKG USA will honor their sale and address these concerns promptly. I urge potential buyers to consider these quality control issues before making a purchase.\n\nThe response from the seller and the outcome of this situation will be monitored closely. I believe I would have rated this 5 stars if not for the issues presented in this review."

          "review": "This is my short review of this TV, its my first time to own a 4K QLED, so from standard HDTV to a 4K QLED 65in is something new and upgrade version and of course this one is better and good picture than my old TV and since this is my first, I can't say this 4K is better than my older 4K, I like the screen thickness its very slim I think half an inch thick, slim bezel, so there is no bulky thick tv and using it on a stand is just right and this is also perfect for hanging it in the wall. Features are good, using its own OS is good runs Netflix, amazon with no complaint, I used an AppleTV 4K so I don't worry about the internal OS, the only thing not so impressive with this TV is the built-in speaker sound, maybe because the slim design so the speaker is also slim that affect the sound, Samsung must improve their design on their internal speaker sound but maybe they assume that all users prefer to have an external subwoofer-speaker system so they don't much give improvement on internal sound. I also don't mind the internal speaker cuz I prefer my old Sony speaker bar with subwoofer and I'm fine with it. All of us have different preferences, requirement and budget, this TV may met your standard or not, Overall recommend this QLED TV and try to shop around like bestbuy and see the actual picture/video quality vs if just looking any reviews from youtube. Additional info. it doesn't mean you will get a big TV its good for your room, check your sofa/bed distance from the TV to get a good quality view."

          "review": "This television was bought to replace one my wife and I had in our bedroom. We needed something with a crisper picture as both of us have had eye issues over the past couple years, but we also wanted something with a nicer picture overall than the older, 32\" model we had been using for years.\n\nAfter looking around we settled on this tv both for its size as well as some of the picture features mentioned above, specifically the clear color and contrast in different environments. This set does not disappoint!\n\nThe picture is super clear right out of the box! The refresh rate and quality of color are impeccable and with lots of use over the last couple months we've had no issues as far as image degradation or pixels going out. The shows we've been watching are clean and crisp, the subtitles when we need them are a good size and have different settings to looking cleaner depending on the situation or program, and the overall watchability of the TV is amazing!\n\nAdd to all of the above the smart TV functionality is wonderful! I was worried that the set might be slower since it's the furthest from our wifi hotspot in the house, but it's been incredible. Honestly, 4k shows take only seconds to begin playing and come through nice and crisp! Browsing all the apps is super simple, and the total setup time for the TV was only a few minutes with all of the apps being able to talk with my phone or be setup using QR codes in seconds. Seriously, this was the fastest I think I've ever setup a tv!\n\nFor the price point I truly believe this TV is excellent and one you should be looking to invest in if you're in the market! I know we couldn't be happier with ours and will definitely keep an eye on Samsung in the future when and if we need to upgrade another set."

          "review": "Never bought a TV from Amazon before, but this was a decently pleasant experience. The first TV we ordered had some visual noise/blurring after 2 weeks of use. Called support and they sent a replacement right away and I only had to box the 1st one and send it back in. It's been over a month now with the replacement and it's a phenomenal experience. 120hz refresh rate is a game changer when viewing movies as images are able to be viewed as intended. Picture quality is amazing and very crisp. I don't care for the HDR as we live in an apt. that has some seriously superb naturally lighting that is very difficult to evade with extreme countermeasures. My wife and I have a rewatched so many movies and shows already as it's a new experience vs. a 60 hz refresh rate TV. Very happy with this purchase and hope it holds well for at least 3 years."

          "review": "I ordered this 65” Samsung as part of Amazons Prime Days sale. The TV is great. Very modern and thin with several HDMI ports for accessories. The picture is great and the set up was pretty easy. It didn’t take long to go through the wizard and add all my apps and streaming services. We use DirectTV streaming and the app works great along with all the others. We also purchased a Samsung soundbar with subwoofer and the set up with the TV was super easy and paired immediately. Only giving 4 stars because the delivery was terrible. You set up the delivery date after purchase and it was a week, not Prime. That would have been fine but on my date of delivery (which I needed to work at home for) they didn’t show up and they didn’t even notify me. The next day no communication either! They finally acknowledged they didn’t show up and my next delivery date was almost 10 days later. Took 3 weeks for a Prime delivery, clearly they were just trying to sell TVs but anyway, the product is good. Recommend the Samsung soundbar and sub as well."

          "rating": "1.0",
          "review": " I purchased the Samsung Q70C 85\" TV from SKG USA, drawn by the promise of 'Used - Like New' condition and the assurance of a full manufacturer's warranty. The claim was that the box had suffered minor damage while the TV remained in perfect condition. No box damaged was noted on arrival. However, within the first 30 days, my expectations were met with disappointment.\n\nDuring a dark room test, the TV, priced at $1700, revealed significant 'clouding' and 'banding' defects. These terms might sound technical, but they simply mean that the screen has uneven patches of brightness ('clouding') and visible lines across the display ('banding'), which are particularly noticeable in darker scenes. For a TV boasting QLED technology, known for its stellar picture quality, this is a surprising and unacceptable issue so early in its lifespan.\n\nDespite the TV's impressive color accuracy, smart features, and design, these screen uniformity flaws are a major letdown, suggesting a potential defect that undermines the value of this high-end model. It's disheartening to encounter such problems on a device that's barely a month old and sold as near-perfect.\n\nI am reaching out through this review in hopes that SKG USA will honor their sale and address these concerns promptly. I urge potential buyers to consider these quality control issues before making a purchase.\n\nThe response from the seller and the outcome of this situation will be monitored closely. I believe I would have rated this 5 stars if not for the issues presented in this review."

          "review": "This is my short review of this TV, its my first time to own a 4K QLED, so from standard HDTV to a 4K QLED 65in is something new and upgrade version and of course this one is better and good picture than my old TV and since this is my first, I can't say this 4K is better than my older 4K, I like the screen thickness its very slim I think half an inch thick, slim bezel, so there is no bulky thick tv and using it on a stand is just right and this is also perfect for hanging it in the wall. Features are good, using its own OS is good runs Netflix, amazon with no complaint, I used an AppleTV 4K so I don't worry about the internal OS, the only thing not so impressive with this TV is the built-in speaker sound, maybe because the slim design so the speaker is also slim that affect the sound, Samsung must improve their design on their internal speaker sound but maybe they assume that all users prefer to have an external subwoofer-speaker system so they don't much give improvement on internal sound. I also don't mind the internal speaker cuz I prefer my old Sony speaker bar with subwoofer and I'm fine with it. All of us have different preferences, requirement and budget, this TV may met your standard or not, Overall recommend this QLED TV and try to shop around like bestbuy and see the actual picture/video quality vs if just looking any reviews from youtube. Additional info. it doesn't mean you will get a big TV its good for your room, check your sofa/bed distance from the TV to get a good quality view."

          "review": "This television was bought to replace one my wife and I had in our bedroom. We needed something with a crisper picture as both of us have had eye issues over the past couple years, but we also wanted something with a nicer picture overall than the older, 32\" model we had been using for years.\n\nAfter looking around we settled on this tv both for its size as well as some of the picture features mentioned above, specifically the clear color and contrast in different environments. This set does not disappoint!\n\nThe picture is super clear right out of the box! The refresh rate and quality of color are impeccable and with lots of use over the last couple months we've had no issues as far as image degradation or pixels going out. The shows we've been watching are clean and crisp, the subtitles when we need them are a good size and have different settings to looking cleaner depending on the situation or program, and the overall watchability of the TV is amazing!\n\nAdd to all of the above the smart TV functionality is wonderful! I was worried that the set might be slower since it's the furthest from our wifi hotspot in the house, but it's been incredible. Honestly, 4k shows take only seconds to begin playing and come through nice and crisp! Browsing all the apps is super simple, and the total setup time for the TV was only a few minutes with all of the apps being able to talk with my phone or be setup using QR codes in seconds. Seriously, this was the fastest I think I've ever setup a tv!\n\nFor the price point I truly believe this TV is excellent and one you should be looking to invest in if you're in the market! I know we couldn't be happier with ours and will definitely keep an eye on Samsung in the future when and if we need to upgrade another set."

I also had a 55\" TCL go kaput after just 2 years. I doubt they've done long term tests on the TCL big screens as the reviews have been glowing, but my experience says steer clear.\n\nIf you're in the market for a reasonably price big screen tv for your living room then look no further as this is a great tv for your average person. This might not be a serious gamer or videophile set but the picture pops and to me the contrast is great which is important.\n\nThese are the pros that were important to me:\n\nPros:\nBeautiful picture especially in higher resolution\nDeeper blacks\nMinimalist remote that works with my Vizio soundbar\nOptical to work with my older soundbar\nNice design with very thin bezel\nRechargeable remote(USB C) with solar recharging also! No batteries to change!\nPleasing interface, easy to navigate\nSamsung product. I've always had good luck with their tv's though I did buy the Asurion insurance just in case.\nSale price was reasonable\n\nCons:\nI had an issue with VESA bolt holes when mounting but I got 'er done.\n\nI'll update if I have any issues."

Ive also had a few issues with random turn offs, or certain apps always having an issue, like netflix, and history channel. I was able to get this tv for such a good deal around black friday so for the value its a great tv. I just dont love the samsung software. All that said, its a solid tv for the price.

          "review": "Samsung 85” TV review. Here’s how it went. First the packing is pitifully flimsy. One of the 4 plastic snaps that hold the ends of the cardboard box was pre-broken, thankfully the other 3 held. The segmented Styrofoam elements formed a chain around only the perimeter of the carton but provided no flex prevention to the carton. Little diagrams stamped along the bottom depicting opening procedures convened nothing instructive but we managed to carefully open the box. Once opened it was about the same size and the Sony 85” it was replacing. Good so far. The single double sides page of instructions were very colorful with tons of arrows, but may have equally been useful for launching jets off an aircraft carrier or construction a bridge beam girder. Only one single item was useful: mounting to a wall bracket requires 4 M8 bolts which were NOT included. Really Samsung? A dimes worth of bolts you can’t provide on a $2K tv? Strike one.\n\nNow all connected and plugged in we reach for the remote to turn on the new tv. The remote is charged not by batteries but a solar window on the back or by USB port, the cable for that was also NOT provided. Luckily I had one that worked and charged the remote enough to begin. Strike two.\n\nThe tv came on in glorious super bright color! I'm talking lighthouse bright. No problem, I’ll tone down the output with settings. But first what’s with the 2” wide band of tiny vertical lines just off the right edge of the screen? Or the 1” band of squiggly bars of colored lines racing across the very bottom of the screen? No amount of scrolling thru endless steps of the limited buttons on the remote would remove or provide any insight of the errant lines on the screen. Strike 3.\n\nA call to customer service was next. I won’t describe the events between dialing the number and finally talking to a person (in India? Pakistan? The Caribbean?) who was very nice and requested a photo of the lines on the screen, texted to a particular number, which I did. No response. We have spent almost 2 hours now and obviously this unit is faulted. Frustration and disappointment fill the room. Back to Amazon it goes. Having spent thousand of dollars on Amazon over the years, this is my first return, and I discover the return process will take up to 37 days to refund my $2200. Lesson learned: no more big expenditures with Amazon.\n\nI have been a fan of Sony television since the Trinitron days. For the past 45 years, every TV I bought for myself or bought for my kids or gifted- was a Sony, including the last one: an 85 incher. Loved it. Then one day it wouldn’t come on. Died after 19 months. NINETEEN MONTHS for a $2300 TV? Disappointed beyond words. But I’m fortunate to have a helpful son (who favors Samsung) and just happens to know everything and rather than go another 10 rounds with him over which TV is best I just bought an 85” Samsung. This was a mistake. Maybe I just got a bad one or maybe the overworked handlers of Amazon weren’t as careful as they could have been, given the inadequate packaging. Possibly some disreputable seller unloaded some questionable name brand components to Amazon, who knows. But over all I prefer the Sony picture, remote and necessary devices included over the Samsung. There are no major electronics retailers within 60 miles of my location so I’ll stuff a sock on my sons mouth and order another Sony; from either Walmart or Circuit City."

They aren't OLED as that style are still pretty pricey but the quality is far superior to other brands. Samsung is a world leading tech manufacturer that excells in innovation and development. They produce most of their own products including their QLED tv/monitor line and all of their AMOLED screens in their galaxy books and smartphones. For the price, this TV is amazing. Everything I watch now is rendered in 4k and it's a world of difference. Even movies from the 80's look completely different. I saw some reviews mentioning their packaging was sub par and they must just be unlucky. Both of my tvs were very secure in their boxes and wrapped and supported with foam to the max. I've honestly never seen anything of low quality from this company. I couldn't be happier. Samsung forever!"

But if Amazon photos are important to you, it's not compatible, although they offer Amazon Alexa and Music...weird. the remote is glitchy and inferior to the Firestick. The 'add apps' is especially frustrating, because there isn't even a space bar on the search. If the app you're looking for isn't offered in the 'suggestions' as you type a partial search....too bad and no way to search. That's goofy. Picture is very good, a soundbar is essential. All in all, worth the current price, but I wouldn't go over that."

My old Samsung TV was around 20 years old, and suddenly the picture was fading to black. My complaint? My TV was mounted and I figured I could just trade out TV’s. WRONG. Samsung decided to change out the mounting holes in the back of their TV, making them considerably smaller than all the screws that came with the mount. I had to wait a few more days to get a special hardware kit from Samsung so I could mount the TV. I CRY FOUL!!"

I always connect my stereo & speakers so I was concerned about how to attach them due to the TV not having that type of port. The Bluetooth feature on my stereo and the Bluetooth pairing feature on the TV made this an easy task. As for volume, in the TV settings menu, I changed the 'Sound Mode' to Amplify. Between this setting and my stereo system the sound is perfect and loud enough for me. In fact, even without my stereo turned on, the TV setting of Amplify makes the TV volume much louder. The remote can be charged either by solar or by attaching a Type C charging cord. As the instructions suggest, I agree using a Samsung Type C cord is best. I have small fingers so I do not mind the size of the remote or its features. I think Samsung is smart and consciousness about not being wasteful and using extra unnecessary materials. Lastly, my TV is facing my main large window. I was concerned about glare and TV brightness of the picture. During set up, I chose the feature which allows the TV to automatically adjust to light. I am also using 'Eco' mode for the brightness. It is perfect for me. I am so glad I bought this TV and will buy the same type from Samsung in the future when/if necessary."

The remote control does not have number buttons, which I thought was weird. Then I realized I only stream TV and haven’t entered a channel number in over 7 years (there is a way to input numbers, there just aren’t any dedicated physical buttons). My only complaint is that I wish it had one more HDMI port and had an ATSC 3.0 tuner. That would have made the TV much more future-proof. If you don’t know what an ATSC tuner is, look it up. If you do, then you know that the 2024 model (maybe 2025) will probably have the 3.0 tuner, as they have been steadily adopted in higher-end TVs since 2020."

I also had a 55\" TCL go kaput after just 2 years. I doubt they've done long term tests on the TCL big screens as the reviews have been glowing, but my experience says steer clear.\n\nIf you're in the market for a reasonably price big screen tv for your living room then look no further as this is a great tv for your average person. This might not be a serious gamer or videophile set but the picture pops and to me the contrast is great which is important.\n\nThese are the pros that were important to me:\n\nPros:\nBeautiful picture especially in higher resolution\nDeeper blacks\nMinimalist remote that works with my Vizio soundbar\nOptical to work with my older soundbar\nNice design with very thin bezel\nRechargeable remote(USB C) with solar recharging also! No batteries to change!\nPleasing interface, easy to navigate\nSamsung product. I've always had good luck with their tv's though I did buy the Asurion insurance just in case.\nSale price was reasonable\n\nCons:\nI had an issue with VESA bolt holes when mounting but I got 'er done.\n\nI'll update if I have any issues."

          "review": "Samsung 85” TV review. Here’s how it went. First the packing is pitifully flimsy. One of the 4 plastic snaps that hold the ends of the cardboard box was pre-broken, thankfully the other 3 held. The segmented Styrofoam elements formed a chain around only the perimeter of the carton but provided no flex prevention to the carton. Little diagrams stamped along the bottom depicting opening procedures convened nothing instructive but we managed to carefully open the box. Once opened it was about the same size and the Sony 85” it was replacing. Good so far. The single double sides page of instructions were very colorful with tons of arrows, but may have equally been useful for launching jets off an aircraft carrier or construction a bridge beam girder. Only one single item was useful: mounting to a wall bracket requires 4 M8 bolts which were NOT included. Really Samsung? A dimes worth of bolts you can’t provide on a $2K tv? Strike one.\n\nNow all connected and plugged in we reach for the remote to turn on the new tv. The remote is charged not by batteries but a solar window on the back or by USB port, the cable for that was also NOT provided. Luckily I had one that worked and charged the remote enough to begin. Strike two.\n\nThe tv came on in glorious super bright color! I'm talking lighthouse bright. No problem, I’ll tone down the output with settings. But first what’s with the 2” wide band of tiny vertical lines just off the right edge of the screen? Or the 1” band of squiggly bars of colored lines racing across the very bottom of the screen? No amount of scrolling thru endless steps of the limited buttons on the remote would remove or provide any insight of the errant lines on the screen. Strike 3.\n\nA call to customer service was next. I won’t describe the events between dialing the number and finally talking to a person (in India? Pakistan? The Caribbean?) who was very nice and requested a photo of the lines on the screen, texted to a particular number, which I did. No response. We have spent almost 2 hours now and obviously this unit is faulted. Frustration and disappointment fill the room. Back to Amazon it goes. Having spent thousand of dollars on Amazon over the years, this is my first return, and I discover the return process will take up to 37 days to refund my $2200. Lesson learned: no more big expenditures with Amazon.\n\nI have been a fan of Sony television since the Trinitron days. For the past 45 years, every TV I bought for myself or bought for my kids or gifted- was a Sony, including the last one: an 85 incher. Loved it. Then one day it wouldn’t come on. Died after 19 months. NINETEEN MONTHS for a $2300 TV? Disappointed beyond words. But I’m fortunate to have a helpful son (who favors Samsung) and just happens to know everything and rather than go another 10 rounds with him over which TV is best I just bought an 85” Samsung. This was a mistake. Maybe I just got a bad one or maybe the overworked handlers of Amazon weren’t as careful as they could have been, given the inadequate packaging. Possibly some disreputable seller unloaded some questionable name brand components to Amazon, who knows. But over all I prefer the Sony picture, remote and necessary devices included over the Samsung. There are no major electronics retailers within 60 miles of my location so I’ll stuff a sock on my sons mouth and order another Sony; from either Walmart or Circuit City."

They aren't OLED as that style are still pretty pricey but the quality is far superior to other brands. Samsung is a world leading tech manufacturer that excells in innovation and development. They produce most of their own products including their QLED tv/monitor line and all of their AMOLED screens in their galaxy books and smartphones. For the price, this TV is amazing. Everything I watch now is rendered in 4k and it's a world of difference. Even movies from the 80's look completely different. I saw some reviews mentioning their packaging was sub par and they must just be unlucky. Both of my tvs were very secure in their boxes and wrapped and supported with foam to the max. I've honestly never seen anything of low quality from this company. I couldn't be happier. Samsung forever!"

If the app you're looking for isn't offered in the 'suggestions' as you type a partial search....too bad and no way to search. That's goofy. Picture is very good, a soundbar is essential.

          "review": "This was my first smart tv to buy at 55\". The picture is amazing and great to game on. However, the streaming services have been abysmal. I have fiber internet so connection isn't the issue. Whenever I use live streaming apps for sports related content (ESPN, Paramount+, Fox Sports, Bally Sports), 10-15 minutes into the event the TV freezes. I have to hard reboot every time this happens. I've tried reinstalling apps, factory reset on the Samsung Smart Hub, and it still occurs. Samsung Service team came out to take a look, and of course it wouldn't freeze up when they were here so there was nothing they could do. Sure enough after they leave it starts freezing up. On some occasions that it doesn't freeze, it will auto swap to the cable antennae (which I don't have set up) or the Samsung Live TV channel.\n\nIt's a shame this is happening because I love the picture quality that it brings and all the settings you can give it, and it's preventing me from having people over to watch a big game knowing that I'll just be resetting my TV every 15 minutes. I was going to return it till I saw that this problem can be alleviated by using a 3rd party streaming device/stick. So I am currently using a ROKU 4k HDR streaming stick, so far no problems. It's a shame that I have to pay for an extra streaming device to properly use this TV, although from what I have researched, Samsung just has bad software in some of their TVs."

          "review": "I wanted a smaller 4K TV for my computer/gaming space. You really can't find 4K TVs that are 40 inches or less. This TV has a great picture and comes packed with features. It has tons of streaming services right out of the box, so you don't need to connect it to satellite/cable. The gaming mode is awesome if you have an Xbox game pass or a Luna account, as you don't need to hook up your Xbox! I also like that when I turn on a gaming system, the TV automatically switches to gaming mode settings. Neat!\n\nOf course, there are bugs. It was finicky with certain HDMI connections - mainly my HDMI switcher. This is kinda the norm with Samsung products, though, so I wasn't that surprised. It also really requires a Samsung Smartthings account and a phone/app. If you're one of those people who hate using your phone/apps to do things (yes, those people exist. I know some) this TV is not for you."

I also had a 55\" TCL go kaput after just 2 years. I doubt they've done long term tests on the TCL big screens as the reviews have been glowing, but my experience says steer clear.\n\nIf you're in the market for a reasonably price big screen tv for your living room then look no further as this is a great tv for your average person. This might not be a serious gamer or videophile set but the picture pops and to me the contrast is great which is important.\n\nThese are the pros that were important to me:\n\nPros:\nBeautiful picture especially in higher resolution\nDeeper blacks\nMinimalist remote that works with my Vizio soundbar\nOptical to work with my older soundbar\nNice design with very thin bezel\nRechargeable remote(USB C) with solar recharging also! No batteries to change!\nPleasing interface, easy to navigate\nSamsung product. I've always had good luck with their tv's though I did buy the Asurion insurance just in case.\nSale price was reasonable\n\nCons:\nI had an issue with VESA bolt holes when mounting but I got 'er done.\n\nI'll update if I have any issues."

          "review": "Samsung 85” TV review. Here’s how it went. First the packing is pitifully flimsy. One of the 4 plastic snaps that hold the ends of the cardboard box was pre-broken, thankfully the other 3 held. The segmented Styrofoam elements formed a chain around only the perimeter of the carton but provided no flex prevention to the carton. Little diagrams stamped along the bottom depicting opening procedures convened nothing instructive but we managed to carefully open the box. Once opened it was about the same size and the Sony 85” it was replacing. Good so far. The single double sides page of instructions were very colorful with tons of arrows, but may have equally been useful for launching jets off an aircraft carrier or construction a bridge beam girder. Only one single item was useful: mounting to a wall bracket requires 4 M8 bolts which were NOT included. Really Samsung? A dimes worth of bolts you can’t provide on a $2K tv? Strike one.\n\nNow all connected and plugged in we reach for the remote to turn on the new tv. The remote is charged not by batteries but a solar window on the back or by USB port, the cable for that was also NOT provided. Luckily I had one that worked and charged the remote enough to begin. Strike two.\n\nThe tv came on in glorious super bright color! I'm talking lighthouse bright. No problem, I’ll tone down the output with settings. But first what’s with the 2” wide band of tiny vertical lines just off the right edge of the screen? Or the 1” band of squiggly bars of colored lines racing across the very bottom of the screen? No amount of scrolling thru endless steps of the limited buttons on the remote would remove or provide any insight of the errant lines on the screen. Strike 3.\n\nA call to customer service was next. I won’t describe the events between dialing the number and finally talking to a person (in India? Pakistan? The Caribbean?) who was very nice and requested a photo of the lines on the screen, texted to a particular number, which I did. No response. We have spent almost 2 hours now and obviously this unit is faulted. Frustration and disappointment fill the room. Back to Amazon it goes. Having spent thousand of dollars on Amazon over the years, this is my first return, and I discover the return process will take up to 37 days to refund my $2200. Lesson learned: no more big expenditures with Amazon.\n\nI have been a fan of Sony television since the Trinitron days. For the past 45 years, every TV I bought for myself or bought for my kids or gifted- was a Sony, including the last one: an 85 incher. Loved it. Then one day it wouldn’t come on. Died after 19 months. NINETEEN MONTHS for a $2300 TV? Disappointed beyond words. But I’m fortunate to have a helpful son (who favors Samsung) and just happens to know everything and rather than go another 10 rounds with him over which TV is best I just bought an 85” Samsung. This was a mistake. Maybe I just got a bad one or maybe the overworked handlers of Amazon weren’t as careful as they could have been, given the inadequate packaging. Possibly some disreputable seller unloaded some questionable name brand components to Amazon, who knows. But over all I prefer the Sony picture, remote and necessary devices included over the Samsung. There are no major electronics retailers within 60 miles of my location so I’ll stuff a sock on my sons mouth and order another Sony; from either Walmart or Circuit City."

They aren't OLED as that style are still pretty pricey but the quality is far superior to other brands. Samsung is a world leading tech manufacturer that excells in innovation and development. They produce most of their own products including their QLED tv/monitor line and all of their AMOLED screens in their galaxy books and smartphones. For the price, this TV is amazing. Everything I watch now is rendered in 4k and it's a world of difference. Even movies from the 80's look completely different. I saw some reviews mentioning their packaging was sub par and they must just be unlucky. Both of my tvs were very secure in their boxes and wrapped and supported with foam to the max. I've honestly never seen anything of low quality from this company. I couldn't be happier. Samsung forever!"

But if Amazon photos are important to you, it's not compatible, although they offer Amazon Alexa and Music...weird. the remote is glitchy and inferior to the Firestick. The 'add apps' is especially frustrating, because there isn't even a space bar on the search. If the app you're looking for isn't offered in the 'suggestions' as you type a partial search....too bad and no way to search. That's goofy. Picture is very good, a soundbar is essential. All in all, worth the current price, but I wouldn't go over that."

I also had a 55\" TCL go kaput after just 2 years. I doubt they've done long term tests on the TCL big screens as the reviews have been glowing, but my experience says steer clear.\n\nIf you're in the market for a reasonably price big screen tv for your living room then look no further as this is a great tv for your average person. This might not be a serious gamer or videophile set but the picture pops and to me the contrast is great which is important.\n\nThese are the pros that were important to me:\n\nPros:\nBeautiful picture especially in higher resolution\nDeeper blacks\nMinimalist remote that works with my Vizio soundbar\nOptical to work with my older soundbar\nNice design with very thin bezel\nRechargeable remote(USB C) with solar recharging also! No batteries to change!\nPleasing interface, easy to navigate\nSamsung product. I've always had good luck with their tv's though I did buy the Asurion insurance just in case.\nSale price was reasonable\n\nCons:\nI had an issue with VESA bolt holes when mounting but I got 'er done.\n\nI'll update if I have any issues."

Ive also had a few issues with random turn offs, or certain apps always having an issue, like netflix, and history channel. I was able to get this tv for such a good deal around black friday so for the value its a great tv. I just dont love the samsung software. All that said, its a solid tv for the price.

          "review": "Samsung 85” TV review. Here’s how it went. First the packing is pitifully flimsy. One of the 4 plastic snaps that hold the ends of the cardboard box was pre-broken, thankfully the other 3 held. The segmented Styrofoam elements formed a chain around only the perimeter of the carton but provided no flex prevention to the carton. Little diagrams stamped along the bottom depicting opening procedures convened nothing instructive but we managed to carefully open the box. Once opened it was about the same size and the Sony 85” it was replacing. Good so far. The single double sides page of instructions were very colorful with tons of arrows, but may have equally been useful for launching jets off an aircraft carrier or construction a bridge beam girder. Only one single item was useful: mounting to a wall bracket requires 4 M8 bolts which were NOT included. Really Samsung? A dimes worth of bolts you can’t provide on a $2K tv? Strike one.\n\nNow all connected and plugged in we reach for the remote to turn on the new tv. The remote is charged not by batteries but a solar window on the back or by USB port, the cable for that was also NOT provided. Luckily I had one that worked and charged the remote enough to begin. Strike two.\n\nThe tv came on in glorious super bright color! I'm talking lighthouse bright. No problem, I’ll tone down the output with settings. But first what’s with the 2” wide band of tiny vertical lines just off the right edge of the screen? Or the 1” band of squiggly bars of colored lines racing across the very bottom of the screen? No amount of scrolling thru endless steps of the limited buttons on the remote would remove or provide any insight of the errant lines on the screen. Strike 3.\n\nA call to customer service was next. I won’t describe the events between dialing the number and finally talking to a person (in India? Pakistan? The Caribbean?) who was very nice and requested a photo of the lines on the screen, texted to a particular number, which I did. No response. We have spent almost 2 hours now and obviously this unit is faulted. Frustration and disappointment fill the room. Back to Amazon it goes. Having spent thousand of dollars on Amazon over the years, this is my first return, and I discover the return process will take up to 37 days to refund my $2200. Lesson learned: no more big expenditures with Amazon.\n\nI have been a fan of Sony television since the Trinitron days. For the past 45 years, every TV I bought for myself or bought for my kids or gifted- was a Sony, including the last one: an 85 incher. Loved it. Then one day it wouldn’t come on. Died after 19 months. NINETEEN MONTHS for a $2300 TV? Disappointed beyond words. But I’m fortunate to have a helpful son (who favors Samsung) and just happens to know everything and rather than go another 10 rounds with him over which TV is best I just bought an 85” Samsung. This was a mistake. Maybe I just got a bad one or maybe the overworked handlers of Amazon weren’t as careful as they could have been, given the inadequate packaging. Possibly some disreputable seller unloaded some questionable name brand components to Amazon, who knows. But over all I prefer the Sony picture, remote and necessary devices included over the Samsung. There are no major electronics retailers within 60 miles of my location so I’ll stuff a sock on my sons mouth and order another Sony; from either Walmart or Circuit City."

They aren't OLED as that style are still pretty pricey but the quality is far superior to other brands. Samsung is a world leading tech manufacturer that excells in innovation and development. They produce most of their own products including their QLED tv/monitor line and all of their AMOLED screens in their galaxy books and smartphones. For the price, this TV is amazing. Everything I watch now is rendered in 4k and it's a world of difference. Even movies from the 80's look completely different. I saw some reviews mentioning their packaging was sub par and they must just be unlucky. Both of my tvs were very secure in their boxes and wrapped and supported with foam to the max. I've honestly never seen anything of low quality from this company. I couldn't be happier. Samsung forever!"

          "review": "This was my first smart tv to buy at 55\". The picture is amazing and great to game on. However, the streaming services have been abysmal. I have fiber internet so connection isn't the issue. Whenever I use live streaming apps for sports related content (ESPN, Paramount+, Fox Sports, Bally Sports), 10-15 minutes into the event the TV freezes. I have to hard reboot every time this happens. I've tried reinstalling apps, factory reset on the Samsung Smart Hub, and it still occurs. Samsung Service team came out to take a look, and of course it wouldn't freeze up when they were here so there was nothing they could do. Sure enough after they leave it starts freezing up. On some occasions that it doesn't freeze, it will auto swap to the cable antennae (which I don't have set up) or the Samsung Live TV channel.\n\nIt's a shame this is happening because I love the picture quality that it brings and all the settings you can give it, and it's preventing me from having people over to watch a big game knowing that I'll just be resetting my TV every 15 minutes. I was going to return it till I saw that this problem can be alleviated by using a 3rd party streaming device/stick. So I am currently using a ROKU 4k HDR streaming stick, so far no problems. It's a shame that I have to pay for an extra streaming device to properly use this TV, although from what I have researched, Samsung just has bad software in some of their TVs."

          "review": "I wanted a smaller 4K TV for my computer/gaming space. You really can't find 4K TVs that are 40 inches or less. This TV has a great picture and comes packed with features. It has tons of streaming services right out of the box, so you don't need to connect it to satellite/cable. The gaming mode is awesome if you have an Xbox game pass or a Luna account, as you don't need to hook up your Xbox! I also like that when I turn on a gaming system, the TV automatically switches to gaming mode settings. Neat!\n\nOf course, there are bugs. It was finicky with certain HDMI connections - mainly my HDMI switcher. This is kinda the norm with Samsung products, though, so I wasn't that surprised. It also really requires a Samsung Smartthings account and a phone/app. If you're one of those people who hate using your phone/apps to do things (yes, those people exist. I know some) this TV is not for you."

Not sure what is the issue here, the control is fully charged but when I turn the set off in the evening, the next morning it only turns the tv on and no other functions is working unless i pair again..\n\nIs this normal??\n\nF.Q."

          "review": "Item came just as described. Nice and heavy duty! Came with several different sizes of screws and spacers. The mount was easy to hang and with lots of cutouts so that I could line up the mount perfectly onto the studs. Also had a paper layout that match’s the base so you could lay out where you want it and predrill your holes for the lag screws. To work for my application I flipped over the head where the tv actually mounts so that the swing arm was on the right side and the mount would still tilt in a downward direction. This was accomplished by removing 1 bolt and flipping it and reinstalling the bolt. Very easy. The other thing I like about it and one of the main reasons i bought this model was because it has a very long reach which will allow me or other users to “get it around obstacles”. As you can see in my pics it had to pull out enough to get around the cabinets for ones on the right side of the room to see. This model easily does that with length to spare!! The mounting bars also have several spaces so that you can find the perfect fit for most TVs. This one had 4 different spots that would allow my tv to mount. The way i chose let some of the bracket hang below the tv which will allow me to mount a board and attach a sound bar to it as well (this may not work for all tvs) however if you didn’t want to see the mounting bars they would have allowed me to mount them flush i just chose not to. Over all this mount is great! Seems to be very sturdy and should last for a long time. Very versatile and has so many mounting holes, tons of tvs should fit. My tv is a LG OLED 65’ C series so if you have one, this mount will work perfect! Only thing I would say and it’s not negative, is that it’s heavy and you will probably want some help holding it up as you lag screw it to the wall. Once hung, your good to go!!"

As a mounting tip I would suggest removing the wall plate from the arms and mounting it first. Once the plate is attached to the wall and level then install the two bolts Required to attach the arms then hang your TV. Very simple install and works very well. The last installation note I will give is to loosen the bolts at the pivot points if you find the TV hard to move. After slightly loosening the bolts the TV moves smoothly And with very little effort."

          "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2023",
          "rating": "2.0",
          "review": "Entirely too stiff. I've got a TV that only weighs 30lbs and I should be able to move it easily, but not with this mount. I feel like I have to be extremely careful and only move it using the actual arms themselves or it is going to rip right out of the wall. Forget trying to adjust it by holding and moving the TV if you don't want to break your TV. The manufacturer suggests oiling it, which I've tried, but it didn't seem to do much, if anything, to relieve the stiffness of the arms."
