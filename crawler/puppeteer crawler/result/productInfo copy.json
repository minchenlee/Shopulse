        "review": "Updated Review Jan/2024…………….\n\nI’ve been using my TV for about 2 months. The TV is just monumental. I love the colors and how flawlessly the PS5 works on it. Also, I am getting more channels with my TV antenna compared to my previous LG or Vizio tvs and they look so good. If my OLED Sony A90J TV was in the return window, I would replaced it for this TV. The OLED colors/resolution/glare is better, obviously, but I don’t think is much difference when you think $3k vs $1k for this TV.\n\nOriginal Review Nov/2023…………..\n\nI recently bought a PS5, so I decided to replaced my 70” LG TV with a Sony one. What can I say, you pay for what you get. I have a 55’’ Sony OLED A90J Master Series in my master bedroom, but decided to get an LED since I watch some tv here and there and may leave the tv on for background noise in the living room, so don’t want issues with burning image on an OLED screen. I read/watched many reviews on this X90L and the X93L and liked that this one was good looking and about 20lbs lighter. The TV looks amazing and is well built. I like the stand legs, they are long and sturdy. The picture quality is nice and way better than my previous LG tv. Perfect timing for me to get it on Black Friday early deals, get it while you can. Amazon delivery and set up was great. I didn’t have to do any lifting at all, friendly staff, and they worked quickly. HIGHLY recommend the Amazon delivery to room of choice. I’m not sure about other people reviews regarding cracked screens. I don’t see any issues with my screens. The TV was packed for the gods, so it has to be hit very hard to be cracked or maybe dropped?"

        "review": "This is the nicest TV I've ever owned in my 40+ years on this planet. My last TV was a 42\"1080p, which was decent, but this thing is on a whole other level!\n\nThe picture on this thing is so good! My cable TV only lets me get decent picture, but when I turn on my Xbox Series X and play a 4k game or watch a DVD or downloaded video I get to see what this thing is capable of, and I love it! I don't see any problems with it at all. I'm not a videophile or expert, but when I saw a random comment here and there about a random thing being a small issue with their TV I tried to recreate the same thing and never got anything that would ever remotely qualify as a problem. Maybe I'm just not sensitive enough, but to me this TV is pretty much perfect.\n\nOne of the nicest surprises of the TV is the sound it puts out! I was kind of expecting decent sound because I've seen that some modern TVs (like my last one) have what is essentially like a little mini soundbar built into the bottom of the TV when they're big enough. Since my last 42\" sounded good I hoped this would too. Well I was NOT disappointed! The sound is really clear, and gets more than loud enough for my small living room (20'x30'). I have never turned it up past 40 and I'm pretty sure it goes up to 100. It's not going to shake the house or make your ears bleed since there's no sub woofer or anything, but for a TV I can't help but to be impressed.\n\nActually, not only is there good sound coming from the bottom of the TV, but Sony seems to have done some kind of magic with speakers mounted in the back on the side of the TV up towards the top. These things can throw sound around the room and create a kind of surround sound. I don't know how they do it, because there isn't even a speaker grill or anything back there, the sound just comes through the plastic. I only noticed because I was standing next to it and heard them. It's a cool feature I wasn't expecting.\n\nAs I sit here typing this I have the TV on and I'm sitting in a menu for Forza Motorsport. The sounds of the menu music really seem like they're coming from the sides, and even behind me a little bit. The sound from this TV really impresses me. More than a few times since I bought it I'll think I hear something outside to my left, but it's just the TV doing it's thing. It's great!\n\nOne thing to note is that this TV is heavy. I believe the box said 70lbs when it was delivered. I have it mounted on the wall and I needed a friend to help me so I didn't risk breaking anything. So if you see the listed weight on here and think that other TVs are so much lighter and easy to pick up so it must be a typo, it isn't. This thing is so much heavier than I thought it would be.\n\nI know there are better TVs out there, but they cost a lot more. I believe Sony pushed the tech in this kind of TV about as far as they can, and in my opinion they did an amazing job. It isn't the latest and greatest, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this TV. If you're on the fence, do it! I think you'll be happy. You've probably done enough research to be where you're wondering if you should pull the trigger. Well I think you should. I don't think you'll be disappointed. I'm so happy I bought this thing! I'll update if anything changes, but part of the reason I bought this is because Sony is supposed to build TVs that last much longer than others. We'll see. Right now I couldn't be happier."

        "review": "Caveat Emptor. The TV is wonderful. Great picture with a cinematic experience. HOWEVER...Amazon dropped the price $200 right after I ordered it. I asked about some kind of adjustment. I understand prices go up and down but it was a $200 price drop within the return period. They wanted to have me return the TV and order a replacement! They would come, take it off the wall, ship it back, send a replacement and mount it again (they would absorb the cost). I suggested we do a \"paper return\" where I generate a return, get the credit, order a new one, get the better price and the TV I have stays put. They couldn't do that. I was trained as an economist and my suggestion made sense in terms of saving time, effort (their) money, truck fumes, etc. FRUSTRATING!"

        "reviewTitle": "Good brightness and motion enhancement",
        "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2023",
        "rating": "4.0",
        "review": "This is a good middle-of-the road TV. It has some great performance features for the class. The standout strengths are excellent brightness, motion interpolation and a good deal of configurability. Its Playstation 5 “awareness” allows it to automatically optimize for the console when plugged in, and make the most out of advanced features like VRR and ALLM. The real stand-out feature here is the motion interpolation or “smoothness” as the menu calls it - it’s hands down the best I’ve ever seen. My privacy matters to me, so this review was conducted without enabling the WiFi or using any of the online features.\n\nPackaging: A\nThis TV ships in a very plain cardboard box, which kind of screams “no frills”, but it has a good many features despite. It’s possible to get the TV out without deconstructing the box - which is a plus in my opinion as if you keep the box you have a safe way to transport it if you’re about to move or whatnot.\n\nPhysical Setup: A+\nThis has to be the simplest TV setup I’ve done since the switch from CRTs to flat panels. The desktop stand is just two feet that plug into the bottom and snap into place - no tools needed. The TV also comes with three sets of mounting screws. This is kind of a big deal as I have the absolute worst luck when it comes to mounting kits- they usually come with five or six different screw options and none of them is ever the correct one for the TV I’m trying to set up. Providing the screws with the TV means I’m not going to be making a trip to the hardware store before I can mount it.\n\nAll of the connections are clearly labeled on the back panel. If you’re installing this with a flush wall mount, you might want to try to plug everything in before you mount it on the wall because there’s not a lot of room to maneuver behind the set once it’s mounted.\n\nRemote: C\nThe remote control unfortunately follows this minimalist trend where rather than have any direct functions on the remote, every function opens some kind of on screen menu that you have to use to operate it.\n\nOn TV Controls: D\nThe TV itself only has two controls - a one-button-does-everything “power” button, and a physical toggle switch to give you the illusion of being able to physically disable the microphone in the TV. If you lose your remote control, you’re going to be extremely limited in what you can do with this TV.\n\nOTA Reception: C\nThe over-the-air channel reception isn’t very good. During the scan it picked up 33 channels including HD and SD, but when I attempted to view the HD channels picked up by the scan they wouldn’t come in at all. (I used the antenna from my 2013 Sony, which does get all of those channels, to test.) The SD channels come in just fine which makes me think there’s something wrong with the tuner itself. If you’re planning on using this for OTA, you might have to upgrade or buy a better antenna.\n\nPrivacy: D\nLike all “Smart” TVs, the manufacturer utilizes the TV to gather information about your watching habits, and record and analyze audio from the viewing environment. As mentioned earlier, they try to give you some sense of privacy with a physical toggle switch for the TV’s microphone, but it’s just an illusion. The TV has an audio calibration function which plays a sound then listens to the echo to set up the speakers; it has no trouble doing this even with the microphone switch set to the “off” position. This means that either the microphone can still be activated in software despite the physical toggle switch, or that there’s at least one more microphone built into the set which is not controlled by the switch. Either way, don’t assume that you aren’t being listened to because the microphone is switched off.\n\nIf privacy is a priority for you, I would recommend not enabling WiFi on this TV at all. You can get firmware updates from Sony and install them with a USB drive, and if you want to use Netflix, Amazon etc… you’re much better off using an external device like a Firestick, Chromecast or XBOX.\n\nDefault Settings: B-\nAll of the default picture modes have the awful “Sharpness” control turned up to the point where it creates visible artifacts and ringing. Almost all of the picture modes have the brightness and contrast cranked to their highest levels, but other than Sharpness, the default configurations are very passable. I don’t know who actually prefers the damage the sharpness feature does to the image, but I very strongly recommend that the first thing you do every time you change a picture mode is to lower the Sharpness its lowest level.\n\nThe Sharpness was not the only default setting that caused some picture degradation. The “Reality Creation” feature describes itself as a super sampling.. Super sampling takes advantage of the fact that when you take a higher resolution image and scale it down to a lower resolution image it seems to maximize the detail possible at the lower resolution. Connect something like a Blu-ray player to an old standard definition CRT TV and you’ll have some idea of what I mean. In this case Reality Creation seems to be scaling the image up, performing some kind of edge interpolation, then scaling it back down. With the feature enabled the image noticeably lost fidelity on most 1080p content. Film grain and other noise inherent to the image was transformed into splotchy glittery patterns which looked terrible to my eyes. I also recommend turning this off unless you’re watching some awful low-resolution source where it might actually do some good.\n\nGaming: B-\nThis TV supports all of the most recent gaming features - Automatic Low Latency Mode (ALLM), Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), and it supports 4K@120Hz. This TV recognized my Playstation 5 and the two devices negotiated a configuration that took advantage of all the features. The gaming mode is a little bit barebones - it does have a crosshair overlay, but it doesn’t have a frame counter so it’s difficult to tell what performance you’re getting without external tools. Even in gaming mode display lag is between 30 and 19 milliseconds (measured with a Time Sleuth). For modern gaming, this is fine for 99% of players. Competitive gamers generally aim for something in single-digits, and for retro gamers this is at the high end of tolerability. By itself 19 milliseconds (best case scenario) is not going to make retro games unplayable, but remember display lag is just one factor in the input latency stack (the time from when you press a button to when you see the action on screen). With display lag this high, it leaves less room for error from your wireless controllers or scaler. For my testing I used a MiSTer FPGA and a very low latency 2.4Ghz retro-bit controller to play Mega Man 2. The game is fairly unforgiving of lag so I often use it as my real-world lag test and I had no trouble completing a couple of stages and boss fights the display lag here was not noticeable to me.\n\nAdvanced Picture Features: B+\nIf picture quality is a priority, I would recommend taking the time to dial in the settings according to some objective process - there are plenty of calibration tutorials online.\n\nI’ve already mentioned my thoughts on “Reality Creation” which does things to the image I don’t like. Super Sampling means that the image is scaled up, smoothed out and scaled back down. In theory this helps with anti-aliasing, but in practice it took away some of the natural sharpness and added noise. YMMV.\n\nThe black levels and HDR tone mapping emphasis are all pretty effective at dramatic changes in the image quality. When playing games like Doom Eternal I was able to really dial in a great picture.\n\nMotion Features: A+\nThis set has three levels of black frame insertion (what it calls “clarity”). This makes the transition from one drawn frame to the next less jarring by inserting a blank frame in between. Each level sacrifices brightness to do this so the higher levels are kind of impractical because of how dim they make the picture, but it’s still a good feature to have to lessen eye strain.\n\nWhere this TV really stands out to me is its motion interpolation capabilities. This is a feature where the TV takes advantage of its very fast refresh rate to invent (interpolate) in-between frames to make on-screen motion smoother and more stable. I’ve been watching this technology evolve over the last 15 years or so, and what they’ve been able to achieve here is stunning - even compared to Samsung’s top of the line 2023 TVs. A major drawback of this feature is artifacting - this is when the circuitry tries to guess what the in-between frame should look like but gets it wrong and draws weird patterns around moving objects. It can be very immersion-breaking. This TV put up with the most punishing material I could throw at it and barely broke a sweat. At the highest setting, there were still periodic artifacts, but at the second highest setting, I counted one instance of artifacting during the whole Super Mario Bros. movie. The 2021 Dune has a lot of vertical panning and fast moving objects and this TV made them look solid and smooth.\n\nContrast Enhancement: D\n“Full Array LED” is straight-up false advertising. For this to actually have what “Full Array LED” describes using a reasonable understanding of those words, it would have one backlight LED for every pixel. In practice it’s not even close. With the local dimming feature enabled, white text on a dark background is constantly surrounded by a very obvious glow from a larger section of the backlight being brightened around the actually bright material onscreen. Thankfully you can turn local dimming off.\n\nViewing Angle: B-\nWhile you can make out detail that’s fairly similar to the correct color from almost 180 degrees off-center, anything wider than 95 degrees is slightly washed out. If you’re used to LCD TVs already you’re not going to notice this at all.\n\nAmbient Light Rejection (Reflections): B+\nThe matte-ish surface of the screen does a very effective job diffusing reflections. Obviously you still don’t want to set this up opposite a sunny window, but a lamp or a crack in the curtains is not going to ruin your viewing experience.\n\nBrightness: B+\nThis TV has the ability to get almost painfully bright which, combined with its ability to reject ambient light which makes it ideal for use in normally to well lit rooms.\n\nBuilt-in Speakers: B\nThe built-in speakers are serviceable. They’re maybe one notch below the quality you’d get with an expensive sound bar. There are a ton of presets and even an auto calibration (which I’ve mentioned earlier) to adjust the sound to your listening environment. I found the “Dolby” setting to be the best all-around, though I’m at a loss for what particular “Dolby” technology is at work here.\n\nFinal Score: B-\nThis is a good all-around LCD TV with a solid set of features, but it doesn’t really excel at most of them. Viewing angles, display lag and local dimming are all somewhat disappointing while not being exactly terrible. Ambient light rejection, brightness, motion enhancements and ease of setup are the high points here."

As a tech guy, I did a lot of research and based on all that i read, it seemed the TCL 7 series was the way to go, but just as i was about to purchase, it went from $698 to $798. I didnt want to pay $800 for an unproven brand made in China, so i continued researching. I came upon a direct comparison between the Sony x90l and the TCL 7 and the reviewer noted that the TCL looked a lot better than expected but the Sony was in a different class. Better in every way from reliability to quality of components, response, features and accuracy. Amazon had an open box in great condition for $898, so i opened an Amazon Visa, got $100 gift card, bought the Sony and got $30 back in rewards. Amazing purchase. Out of the box, the auto lighting was making it too dark, so i turned off energy saving and auto dimming. Then i chose the vivid color setting and dialed the brightness and contrast down to taste. You'll have do that for each input."

        "review": "It is not an OLED, but the image is second to none. Nice size on my wall and the smart features work awesome. Picture when gaming is spot on and color needed no adjusting. When streaming I use vivid and my external set up. I have to admit that it concerned me at first putting the tv on the wall instead of standing, but because the tv is so large the risk of the tv tipping over made me take the chance of putting it in the wall. It went right up and have not had any issues. I connected an Apple TV and most times just use that remote to navigate."

        "review": "I really tried to like this tv, but the S95B has definitely spoiled me... even after all the nerfs and plainly bad updates. The x90l just doesn't hold a candle to an oled in HDR content. The processing really does carry this tv though, the way its able to focus on highlight with so little dimming zones is really impressive, I was also very pleased with the motion and sharpening features.\n\nUnfortunately it just doesn't do good enough In darker content, especially anything with black bars, the image would look lifted in those scenarios. I tested only a few movies, but really wasn't pleases with how dark HDR was and how it inherently forced the Sony to struggle. In SDR content, I was consistently blown away by the brightness compared to my oled, it even came close in color, but didn't have the deep reds that the S95B had.\n\nUser interface: This was one of my biggest gripes with the tv, none of the menu’s and apps use your tv's settings or local dimming, so everything looks pretty bad unless you're playing content. Another problem I had was with the settings menu not saving my motion settings, and also not having separate presets for Hdr and Sdr, I like to use DCI color for Sdr and keep it on Auto for Hdr, but I have to switch them back and forth everytime. It also just feels kinda clunky sometimes.\n\nSound: I have the tv setup on a table with the lowest feet adjustment, and all I can say is tinny... the speakers have almost know noticeable bass \"even with it boosted in the eq\". The cinema mode was the best sound mode, but I would definitely recommend a sound bar, I personally use a pair of Jamo s803 bookshelf speakers with a Yamaha rv685 receiver \"the receiver is definitely overkill\" Also the s95b murders this tv in the sound department to.\n\nSo my conclusion is it's alright for the price, I didn't enjoy it that much for gaming, as my panel had pretty noticeable Dse and It looked surprisingly blurry in motion, even for Lcd standards. The Sdr performance is great, and almost eye searingly bright, but Hdr falls flat and doesn't give the contrast you need for most content, Demo content looks good, but movies/shows are typically mastered a lot darker and it will show this tvs weaknesses.\nFor what it offers, I think it should be cheaper, and from what I've scene in-store, the u8k is much better overall. I got this tv because I wanted a 65in over my 55 and also wanted to see if the brightness would win me over, but the only time it's brighter is in Sdr and the s95b crushes in Hdr, no contest. I will be getting a s90c in 65in instead and would recommend the same, regardless of the price difference."

        "review": "I should have known a Google tv would be creepily intrusive and buggy.\n\nAfter hanging the tv, I went through the basic set up process, skipping the option to sign into a Google account, because, why? The process still took several minutes, and in the end I ended up with two different TV inputs, one of which didn’t work and was somehow the default. I only have one tv - the set up process actually asks you to set up tv twice. At one point it even told me to switch my HDMI input too. I thought this was a nice tip - “use this input for better quality because when you set this up the first time it wasn’t optimal” - but little did I know it was trying to configure a second tv input. Which, why did it recognize my tv signal and then ask me to set up another input WITH THE SAME SIGNAL? I’m one of those who read all instructions, and no where did it make it clear what was happening. The setup process is long and not totally clear.\n\nSo after the setup, the tv watching interface is actually nice. It tried to get the remote to sync with my cable box, but that didn’t work, no biggie. The basic user interface is nice. You can switch inputs while still watching tv. Navigating and downloading apps is simple.\n\nThe remote control feels good in your hand and seems simple enough. It has 2 “settings” buttons…one with a gear icon and one with a wrench icon, that do different things, go figure. There is a pause/play button, but no fast forward/rewind, so I had a hard time navigating to my favorite spot in Avatar 2. The remote has pre-set buttons for Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, YouTube, crunchyroll, and Bravia core. These are the only apps you can use without signing into a Google account, unfortunately.\n\nSo in order to download Max and Paramount+, I started the process to sign into a Google account. This experience was amazingly bad. There was no option to use a QR code or other device to sign in - I had to type my email into the tv using the remote. And then the worst part - it hit me with a CAPTCHA. Except you can’t use the remote control to choose all the pictures with traffic lights or motorcycles. The remote control literally does nothing on the CAPTCHA screen. At this point I was blocked. Couldn’t sign into my account, couldn’t back out of the screen, couldn’t get past the CAPTCHA. Turning the tv off and on brought me right back there. How could this process get past the QA team?\n\nSo I found instructions online to factory reset the tv. This time I went through and signed into my Google account in the initial setup process. This time was much smoother with no QR code. Tip: if you intend to use the smart features of this tv, sign into Google upfront.\n\nI haven’t yet mentioned the number of opt-out options there are going through set up. You have to agree to various privacy policies and 3rd party agreements. Anyone remember the old days of downloading shareware and having to click “I don’t accept” to all the bloat-ware that would try to be installed? That’s what I was reminded of. There are at least 6 different things I had to say no to. And of course the tv doesn’t really give you hints on what is required or optional, from Sony or from Google or another 3rd party. It was like walking through a row of carnival barkers.\n\nI’ve bought several other tvs recently (two last Christmas) that were not Google tvs, and those experiences bore no resemblance to this privacy-stealing circus.\n\nBut wait, you still can’t use all the features - like the “power on” experience - unless you also register the tv using an email. I can’t believe a tv this expensive requires so much data from you.\n\nLet’s talk about the picture quality. It’s crisp and has dark darks. It doesn’t have any banding or compression artifacts (you know, those fuzzy spots in dark scenes) like I did on my last tv. It is quite dim by default, even with eco-mode turned off, but changing the image mode to “vibrant” brightened everything up. The annoying frame interpolation mode is on by default, but what tv doesn’t do that nowadays. At least it’s a better quality interpolation.\n\nThe back of the tv is nicely designed, with inputs and power plug located on the edges of the tv, where they’re easy to reach while the tv is still mounted. The VESA holes are kind of low, which means the tv sits higher than you’d expect when mounting. You might want to get very long mounting brackets so you have more adjustment options.\n\nThe processor on the tv is fast too. It starts up pretty quickly, and navigating menus or starting/switching apps is responsive and smooth. Sound quality is fine, nothing to write home about.\n\nSo to summarize, the basic things you’d watch this tv for are good, but not amazing. The rest of the experience made me go into a green Hulk rage. I would not recommend spending $1300 on this tv. You can get just as nice picture quality without the hassle for much less. You’d think a Google subsidy would actually make this tv cheaper. I won’t get another Google tv, but this one I think should only be in the $700 range."

        "review": "This is a review of the Sony 75 Inch 4K Ultra HD TV X90L Series: BRAVIA XR Full Array LED Smart Google TV with Dolby Vision HDR.\n\nPrior to buying this TV, I was looking at a Sony OLED, but could only afford a 65-inch set and even that was twice as much as this 75-incher. After looking at this set for a week, all I can say is wow. While the OLED may be better on paper, in a real viewing environment, most people could never see the subtle difference in black level or contrast. While the “full array” LED backlight may not be as well-defined as some of the new micro-LED backlight systems, I have yet to notice any blooming on any content I’ve watched. The blacks are impressively BLACK and the colors were as perfect as I could see right out of the box.\n\nMy only gripe is that all the power-saving and motion-smoothing features are on by default, so I did have to hunt them down and turn all that off to avoid having movies look like video games. But the colors are perfect. Not too saturated and not too bland. It just looks great.\n\nI suppose Sony wants their content (it’s a movie studio, too) to look good on their devices, so it’s in their interest to not build a TV that looks horrible.\n\nThe sound is better than any TV I’ve owned, but still not as good as a stand-alone system. Thankfully, the screen can be shut off if you are listening only to music and can route the sound through an optical output to a separate amp and speakers.\n\nOne star off for the aforementioned power and motion settings, but highly recommended otherwise."

        "review": "This Sony Bravia 90 series is the absolute best tv I have ever purchased. I will be honest here on the OLED tv's. Yes, they are vivid, yes they are bright and eye popping, but they are over contrasted, over sharpened and over the top to me on just about everything. When I watch tv I want a set that looks as great on the tv as it does to the naked eye, and to me this is it! What also sold me on this set is Costco had one of these running in the store on the antenna receiving tv on a paper clip. That was something to me and reception was good on a simple paper clip. I had a Vizio that died before this and the antenna reception on those are total junk. I have 2 tv antennas up now with issues with reception of the weak powered VHS frequency broadcasting ABC and when I went shopping for a tv I wanted the best in reception for off air signals and Sony is number 1! The photos I put up here show the signal diagnostics it has within it and what it shows you on antenna reception and it is the best also. It gives you the frequency it's broadcast on, the Signal to noise ratio and the strength and is extremely helpful when working on antenna positioning and amplifying preamp/dist. amp adjustments. I will tell you honestly if you want the best in a 4k non OLED television THIS IS IT! f"

        "review": "There's no perfect TV.\n\nThis TV trades off a little blooming for great up scaling. To me, this is #1 priority since most of the content out there is still in 1080p or less and I hate motion interpolation.\n\nSony's that have mini-LED (which have less blooming) are too big and expensive.\n\nThe Samsung's min-LED's have less blooming, apparently, but may not have as good upscaling.\n\nOled's in my price range have stutter and ABL issues. I find the LG C2 to dark and artificial looking.\n\nThe blooming is not often noticeable because you are uncertain if there is blooming or whether a light source should have normal blooming. Only by comparing it to an OLED can you see the difference (although it will look better).\n\nI never had a problem with subtitles because you can format them now on Amazon. However, HDTVtest does have the worst examples. I have not encountered that."
